# UPFRONT — Game Pitch Document

**Game Dev Tycoon meets Mad Men**

*An advertising agency sim where you chase the Super Bowl, manage creative egos, and discover that the best ad you ever made is the one the client killed.*

---

## THE HOOK

*[HYPE speaks]*

### Elevator Pitch

**Run a 2000s ad agency where your creative team's brilliance and your clients' cowardice are on a collision course — and the Super Bowl is the finish line.**

### Scroll-Stop Line

> "My best ad had a talking chimpanzee, a retired NFL quarterback, and a joke about the internet. The client wanted a product shot with a voiceover. We compromised. America saw the chimpanzee. We won a Clio. The client fired us."

### The "Oh, That's Cool" Moment

Picture this: It is Super Bowl Sunday. The pregame countdown ticks on a retro widescreen CRT in your agency's bullpen. Your team has been grinding for weeks on a 30-second spot for BrightBurst Energy Drink. The client wanted safe — product hero, celebrity endorsement, call to action. Your creative director went rogue and pitched a surreal mini-film about a man who runs across America powered by a single sip, crossing deserts, swimming oceans, sprinting through Times Square, all in one unbroken tracking shot. You greenlit the rogue version. The budget ballooned. The client is nervous. The spot airs. The screen cuts to a simulated living room focus group — dozens of AI viewers reacting in real time. Laughter. Confusion. One guy yells "what was that even for?" Then the internet discourse panel lights up. Forums explode. The cultural impact meter spikes. Monday morning: BrightBurst's brand awareness is up 340%. Their brand trust is down 12%. Your phone rings. It is a bigger client. It is also BrightBurst's lawyers.

That sequence — the tension of watching your ad air and America react in split-screen — is a 5-second GIF that stops every scroll on every feed. Nobody has made this game. Everyone has felt this moment.

## THE CORE

*[REED speaks]*

### Core Loop

**30-second loop**: You are looking at a creative brief on your desk. A client wants a campaign. You assign team members from your roster — a Creative Director, a Copywriter, an Art Director, and a Producer — each with distinct stats, styles, and egos. Their chemistry generates a **Concept Pitch**: a procedurally assembled ad concept built from tone tags, humor vectors, celebrity talent slots, production ambition levels, and cultural risk scores. You read the pitch. You approve, revise, or kill it. Every decision burns daylight on the project calendar.

**5-minute loop**: Develop a full campaign from brief to broadcast. Navigate the **Approval Gauntlet** — present concepts to AI clients who have brand guidelines, risk tolerances, personal taste biases, and quarterly sales targets. The client pushes back. Your creative director pushes back harder. You mediate. Compromise dilutes the concept but secures the budget. Boldness risks client walkout but produces award-worthy work. Once approved, enter the **Production Pipeline**: allocate budget across casting, location, VFX, sound design, and edit. Each allocation shifts the final ad's stats across five axes — Production Value, Humor, Emotion, Originality, and Brand Clarity. The ad is "shot" (procedurally assembled from your choices), and you watch a storyboard-style preview before it airs.

**Session loop (45-90 minutes)**: Play through a full calendar year in the ad industry. Manage multiple client accounts simultaneously. Juggle team fatigue, creative morale, award season submissions, and the ultimate prize: a Super Bowl ad slot. The year culminates in **Super Bowl Sunday** — a climactic event where your flagship ad airs during the big game and the simulated American public reacts in real time. Post-Super Bowl: brand metrics shift, awards are announced, new clients come calling (or don't), and your agency's reputation score updates. Begin the next year with new leverage, new talent, and new impossible clients.

### Core Mechanics

1. **The Brief System**: Every project begins with a Client Brief — a procedurally generated document specifying brand identity, target demographic, campaign goals, budget ceiling, and a list of non-negotiables ("must include the mascot," "no humor," "needs a celebrity"). Briefs have hidden priorities: what the client says they want versus what would actually move their metrics. Reading between the lines is a skill the player develops over dozens of campaigns. The brief is the seed from which all creative tension grows.

2. **Team Chemistry Engine**: Your agency roster consists of individual creatives, each with stats across six axes — **Vision** (big ideas), **Craft** (execution quality), **Speed** (deadline reliability), **Ego** (resistance to notes), **Taste** (preference for certain ad styles), and **Ambition** (willingness to push boundaries). Assigning a team to a project generates chemistry scores: compatible creatives produce cohesive work fast; clashing egos produce either brilliant friction or a flameout. A high-Vision Creative Director paired with a high-Craft Copywriter and a high-Ego Art Director might produce a stunning concept that is three weeks late and 40% over budget. Managing people IS the management game.

3. **The Concept Forge**: When a team is assigned to a brief, the **Concept Forge** procedurally generates 2-3 ad concepts based on the team's combined stats, the brief's parameters, and a degree of controlled randomness. Each concept is defined by its **Tone** (funny, emotional, provocative, surreal, earnest), **Hook Type** (celebrity cameo, narrative mini-film, visual gag, musical number, shock value, slice-of-life), **Production Ambition** (lo-fi/scrappy to blockbuster), and **Cultural Risk Score** (safe to polarizing). The player doesn't design ads from scratch — they curate, select, and refine what their team generates. This models the real creative director's job: you do not make the work; you choose the work.

4. **The Approval Gauntlet**: Present your chosen concept to the AI client in a presentation-room interface. The client reacts dynamically based on their brand personality, risk tolerance, and current market position. A client whose sales are slipping will be more open to risk. A client riding high will demand "more of what's working." Client feedback comes as revision requests — "can we make it funnier?", "lose the monkey," "what if we added a QR code?" Each revision nudges the ad's stats. The player chooses which notes to implement and which to push back on. Pushback costs **Client Trust**; compliance costs **Creative Integrity**. Both are tracked. Both matter. This is the central tension of the entire game: the Approval Gauntlet is where art meets commerce, and the player stands in the middle.

5. **Super Bowl Sunday**: The climactic annual event. If you have secured a Super Bowl slot (through client budget, agency reputation, and successful bidding in the **Media Buy Auction**), your ad airs during the simulated big game. The screen splits: on one side, your ad plays as a storyboard animatic with key stats overlaid. On the other, a real-time **America Reacts** panel shows simulated viewer sentiment — laughter, confusion, boredom, outrage, tears, memes. Post-game, the **Monday Morning** report calculates cultural impact, brand metric shifts, award nominations, and viral reach. A great Super Bowl ad can define your agency's year. A bad one can end a client relationship. A controversial one can do both simultaneously.

### What Mastery Looks Like

A beginner accepts every brief, assigns teams randomly, takes all client notes, and produces safe, forgettable ads that keep the lights on but never win awards or attract premium clients. They survive but never thrive.

An expert reads the hidden priorities in a brief and knows that "the client says they want brand awareness but their real problem is brand perception." They assemble teams with deliberate chemistry conflicts — pairing a high-Ego Art Director with a high-Vision Creative Director because they know that specific friction produces provocative concepts that score high on Originality. They navigate the Approval Gauntlet strategically, conceding on small notes to build Client Trust reserves they spend on protecting the one element that makes the ad special. They manage the annual calendar like a chess board — taking safe bread-and-butter accounts in Q1 to fund the ambitious Super Bowl pitch in Q3. They know which awards juries reward (Originality and Craft) and which clients care about awards (the ones whose CMOs are about to job-hop). They play the people, the calendar, the market, and the culture simultaneously.

The depth ceiling is real: at hour 40, the player is not just managing ads — they are managing an ecosystem of egos, budgets, brand narratives, and cultural timing. The difference between a good player and a great one is the same difference between a competent agency and a legendary one: knowing when to fight for the work.

### Unique Mechanic

**The Approval Gauntlet** — the structured negotiation between creative vision and client demands, where every concession and every act of defiance has tracked mechanical consequences. Other tycoon games let you build things and sell things. Upfront makes you *defend* things. The ad is not the product — the *pitch* is the product. The act of presenting, persuading, compromising, and occasionally walking away is the core verb that no other simulation game centers. Game Dev Tycoon asks "what game do you make?" Upfront asks "what are you willing to sacrifice to make it?"

## THE HEART

*[NOVA speaks]*

### Theme

**Beneath the spreadsheets and storyboards, this game is about the war between expression and approval.**

Every creative person knows the wound: you made something true, and someone with authority told you to make it palatable. You made something palatable, and it haunted you at 2 AM because you knew it could have been true. Upfront is not a game about advertising. It is a game about what happens to a vision when it has to survive contact with someone who is paying for it.

The question the game asks, over and over, in a hundred different briefs and a hundred different presentations: *Is the version of this that the world sees the version that deserved to exist?*

This is a question every artist, every designer, every writer, every musician has asked. Advertising is simply the arena where the question is most naked, most transactional, most brutally honest. The client has the money. You have the idea. The negotiation between those two forces is the oldest story in creative work. Upfront turns it into a system you can play.

### The World

The year is 2003. The dot-com bubble has burst but the dust is glittering. Television is still king, and the Super Bowl is its throne room. Advertising agencies occupy glass-and-steel mid-rises in Manhattan, their lobbies decorated with framed Clio Awards and Sports Illustrated covers. The internet exists but it is not yet the main stage — it is the after-party, the water cooler, the place where people talk about what they saw on TV last night. A viral ad means people are emailing a QuickTime file to their coworkers, not sharing a TikTok.

The wound of this world is *the tension between art and commerce laid completely bare*. Everyone in the agency knows they are selling things. Everyone in the agency also knows that the best way to sell things is to make people feel something real. The cynics and the romantics share the same open-plan office. The account executives who care only about billings sit ten feet from the art directors who still believe a 30-second spot can be cinema. The world cracks along this line — and the player walks the crack.

The texture is specific and evocative: Aeron chairs and Herman Miller desks. Presentation rooms with rear-projection screens. Mood boards pinned to cork walls with actual pushpins. Edit suites with blue-glowing monitors. Media buy spreadsheets in Excel 2003. Coffee that is always burnt. A kitchen whiteboard that says "DAYS UNTIL SUPER BOWL: 47." The hum of ambition and deadline dread in a fluorescent-lit hallway at 11 PM.

### Player's Emotional Arc

**First year**: Wonder and discovery. The player is learning the rhythms of agency life — the thrill of a great concept, the sting of a client killing it, the rush of seeing an ad "air" and watching numbers move. Everything is new. The first Super Bowl is exhilarating regardless of outcome.

**Mid-career (years 2-4)**: Mastery and moral friction. The player is good at this now. They can read clients, manage teams, and produce effective work. But effectiveness and greatness are diverging. The player starts to feel the pull: the safe ad that the client loves and the bold ad that the team believes in are increasingly different ads. The player's Creative Integrity score and Client Trust score begin to tell a story about who they are becoming. Are they an artist running a business, or a businessperson employing artists?

**Late career (years 5+)**: Legacy and reckoning. The agency has a reputation now — and that reputation was built by every compromise and every act of courage the player chose. The late game surfaces long-term consequences: creative teams who stayed because you fought for their work, or left because you didn't. Clients who trust you because you always delivered, or clients who seek you out because your name means something daring. The player looks at their agency and sees a mirror. The emotional destination is not victory or failure — it is *recognition*. You built this. It looks like you.

### The Story Hook

**What kind of agency are you building?**

There is no single protagonist, no central mystery, no final boss. The narrative engine is the accumulation of choices across years of briefs, pitches, and Super Bowls. Every campaign is a short story. Every year is a chapter. The agency itself is the character — and the player is authoring its identity through a thousand small decisions about what work to fight for and what work to let go.

But there are narrative threads that emerge: the Creative Director who threatens to quit if you take one more pharma account. The client who has been with you since year one and whose brand you know better than they do. The rival agency that keeps beating you at Cannes. The junior copywriter who pitched a weird idea in a brainstorm that you almost killed but didn't, and it became the ad that defined your decade. These stories are not scripted — they emerge from the systems. Every mechanic tells a story, and the story Upfront tells is about the cost and the glory of making things for other people.

## THE MARKET

*[HYPE speaks]*

### Target Audience

**Primary**: Players aged 24-40 who love management sims and tycoon games but want one with personality. They have 200+ hours in Game Dev Tycoon, Project Highrise, Two Point Hospital, or Megaquarium. They are drawn to games with expressive systems — games where your choices produce something you can look at and say "I made that." They hang out on r/tycoon, r/BaseBuildingGames, and Steam curator pages for simulation games.

**Secondary**: Creative industry professionals and advertising veterans aged 28-45 who will play this game and feel *seen*. Designers, copywriters, art directors, producers, marketers — anyone who has ever sat in a conference room and watched a client dismantle a concept they loved. This audience does not typically identify as "gamers" but will find this game through word of mouth, industry media (AdAge, Creative Review, Campaign), and the inevitable "this game gets advertising right" discourse on LinkedIn and Twitter/X.

**Tertiary**: Fans of the Mad Men / Halt and Catch Fire / Succession school of prestige drama who love stories about ambitious people in high-stakes creative industries. They play narrative-heavy games and will be drawn to the character dynamics and the moral friction of the Approval Gauntlet.

### Comparable Games

1. **Game Dev Tycoon** meets **Mad Men**: The structural DNA — a tycoon game about a creative industry, tracking trends, managing teams, and shipping products. But where Game Dev Tycoon abstracts the creative process into sliders, Upfront makes the *negotiation over creative vision* the central mechanic.

2. **Two Point Hospital** meets **Disco Elysium**: Two Point's accessible management sim structure married to Disco Elysium's character-driven writing and personality systems. The creatives in your agency are not stat blocks — they are people with opinions, egos, and breaking points.

3. **Hardspace: Shipbreaker** meets **The Movies (2005)**: Hardspace's "every shift tells a story" session structure combined with The Movies' Hollywood studio management and procedural content creation. Each campaign is a contained dramatic arc within a larger career narrative.

4. **Slay the Spire** meets **The Gruen Transfer**: The strategic hand-management of a deck-builder — but instead of cards, you are managing creatives, concepts, and client relationships. Each brief is a new "run" within the larger career metagame. The Gruen Transfer's dissection of advertising as both art and manipulation is the tonal north star.

5. **Football Manager** meets **30 Rock**: Football Manager's depth of personnel management and simulated outcomes applied to a creative agency instead of a football club. The player never "makes" the ad — they manage the people who make the ad, exactly as Football Manager's player never kicks the ball. 30 Rock's understanding that creative work is simultaneously sacred and absurd provides the comedic tone.

### Unique Selling Proposition

There are management sims about game studios, hospitals, theme parks, prisons, and zoos. There has never been a management sim about an advertising agency. The setting is untapped, immediately legible, and culturally rich. Everyone knows what a Super Bowl ad is. Everyone has an opinion about ads. The Super Bowl is the only context where Americans actively *want* to watch commercials — it is the one moment where advertising becomes entertainment, and Upfront turns that moment into a climax mechanic.

Beyond the setting: no tycoon game has ever made *defending your creative work against client feedback* the core loop. The Approval Gauntlet is a mechanic that does not exist in any shipped game. It transforms a passive genre (build, optimize, watch numbers go up) into an active, dramatic one (present, persuade, compromise, stand your ground).

### Platform Fit

**PC (Steam)**: Primary. The management sim audience lives on Steam. The interface density — spreadsheets, mood boards, storyboards, org charts — is native to mouse-and-keyboard. Steam's recommendation algorithm will surface this to Game Dev Tycoon, Two Point Hospital, and The Movies wishlists.

**Nintendo Switch**: Secondary post-launch. The session-based structure (one campaign = 15-20 minutes; one year = 60-90 minutes) maps well to portable play. Management sims perform strongly on Switch.

**Mobile (iPad)**: Tertiary. The touch interface is natural for mood boards and drag-and-drop team assignment. Premium release, not free-to-play.

## THE SCOPE

### Feature Pillars (non-negotiable)

1. **The Brief System & Concept Forge**: Procedurally generated client briefs with hidden priorities and AI-driven concept generation based on team chemistry. This is the seed that grows every campaign. Without it, there is no game.

2. **The Approval Gauntlet**: The structured client-presentation mechanic where creative vision and client demands collide. Pushback, compromise, and negotiation with tracked consequences for both Client Trust and Creative Integrity. This is the unique verb. This is what makes Upfront different from every other tycoon game.

3. **Team Chemistry Engine**: Creatives with distinct personalities, stats, egos, styles, and ambitions. Team composition determines output quality, speed, and volatility. Personnel management is not a support system — it is a core pillar.

4. **Super Bowl Sunday**: The annual climax event. Media buy auction, ad airing simulation, real-time America Reacts panel, Monday Morning metrics report. This is the spectacle, the stakes, and the reason the player pushes through 11 months of grind. Every management sim needs its "launch day." This is ours, and it is the biggest launch day in the world.

5. **Agency Reputation & Legacy System**: A persistent reputation score shaped by every campaign, every award, every client relationship, and every creative choice. The agency's identity emerges from player behavior, not player selection. You do not choose to be "the bold agency" — you become it by fighting for bold work, and the game reflects that identity back to you through the clients who seek you out and the talent who wants to work for you.

### Stretch Goals (ordered by impact)

1. **Rival Agencies**: 2-3 AI-controlled competing agencies with distinct creative philosophies (one is safe and corporate, one is reckless and award-hungry, one is boutique and trendy). They compete for the same clients and the same Super Bowl slots. Seeing their ads "air" alongside yours adds competitive texture.

2. **Award Season**: A full Clio Awards / Cannes Lions simulation. Submit your best work, face jury evaluation, win or lose against rival agencies. Awards boost reputation and attract talent but do not directly generate revenue — modeling the real industry tension between awards and billings.

3. **Cultural Trend System**: A simulated cultural zeitgeist that shifts year to year. What was edgy in 2001 is passé by 2004. Patriotic ads spike post-9/11. Ironic detachment rises. The player must read the cultural moment and calibrate creative tone accordingly. Trends are telegraphed through a simulated media feed in the agency lobby.

4. **Client Career Mode**: Key client contacts have their own career arcs. The CMO who hired you gets promoted and brings you to their new company. The brand manager who killed your best ad gets fired and is replaced by someone bolder. Client relationships persist across companies, not just brands.

5. **Agency Office Customization**: Unlock and place office furniture, art, awards, and decor that reflect your agency's culture and provide passive stat bonuses. A fully-stocked edit suite improves Production Value. A foosball table improves team Morale. A wall of Clio Awards improves recruitment. The office becomes a visual autobiography.

### Cut List (NOT in v1)

- **Multiplayer / competitive agency vs. agency**: The pacing and information density are designed for single-player. Multiplayer would require a fundamentally different game.
- **Player-authored ad content**: The player is a creative director, not a copywriter or artist. Procedural concept generation is essential — letting players write their own ads would break the management-sim loop and create an entirely different design problem.
- **Historical real-world brands**: Licensing is prohibitive and constraining. Fictional brands that evoke real archetypes (a cola brand, a car brand, a dot-com startup) are more flexible and more legally viable.
- **Full video playback of produced ads**: Ads are represented as storyboard animatics with stat overlays and audience reaction data. Full video generation is a scope black hole.
- **Agency expansion beyond a single office**: Multiple offices, international campaigns, and global brand management are sequel territory. V1 is one agency, one city, one Super Bowl.

## KEY ART / MOOD DIRECTION

**Hero image**: A wide-angle view of a 2000s ad agency bullpen at golden hour, shot from above at a slight Dutch angle. In the foreground, a long conference table is covered in printed storyboards, marker-scrawled mood boards, and half-empty coffee cups. A rear-projection screen at the end of the room glows with a paused frame from a commercial — a silhouetted figure mid-leap against an orange sky. Around the table, four people in various states of passionate argument: one standing and gesturing at the screen, one leaning back with arms crossed, one furiously sketching on a notepad, one staring at a BlackBerry. Through floor-to-ceiling windows behind them, a city skyline at dusk. The color palette is warm office amber (`#D4A76A`), cool monitor blue (`#4A90D9`), presentation-screen white (`#F5F0E8`), and the deep charcoal of a late-night deadline (`#2C2C2C`). A red accent (`#C0392B`) appears on a single Post-it note on the mood board that says "SUPER BOWL?"

**UI mood**: The interface IS the agency. The main screen is the agency floor — an isometric or top-down view of your office with interactive zones. Click the Presentation Room to enter the Approval Gauntlet. Click the Creative Bullpen to manage teams and review concepts. Click the Edit Suite to oversee production. Click the Media Buying desk to manage budgets and ad placements. Diegetic UI throughout: briefs are printed documents, concept pitches are mood boards, budgets are Excel spreadsheets with the classic XP-era toolbar, inter-office communication is instant messages in a faux-AIM window. The font stack is Helvetica Neue for headlines, a warm serif like Georgia for body text, and Courier for budget figures and internal memos. Color palette across UI: warm cream backgrounds (`#FAF3E0`), navy blue navigation bars (`#1B2A4A`), Clio gold accents (`#D4AF37`), urgent red for deadline warnings (`#E74C3C`), and the sickly green of a budget spreadsheet cell that just turned negative (`#7D9B6A` fading to `#C0392B`).

**Audio mood**: The ambient soundscape of a working office — distant phone rings, keyboard clacking, muffled conversation through glass walls, the hum of fluorescent lights. Music shifts with context: presentation rooms get a confident, jazzy underscore with brushed drums and walking bass (think Vince Guaraldi scoring a pitch meeting). The Edit Suite gets a focused, electronic-ambient hum. Super Bowl Sunday gets a building orchestral swell that crescendos when your ad airs and cuts to silence — then the roar of the America Reacts panel. The emotional range runs from the quiet satisfaction of a perfectly crafted storyboard at midnight to the adrenaline of watching your 30-second masterpiece play for a simulated 100 million people.

## OPEN QUESTIONS AND NEXT STEPS

### Design Questions [REED]
- What is the right number of simultaneous client accounts to manage before the plate-spinning becomes stressful instead of strategic? Three active campaigns feels right; five might be too many for year one.
- How granular should the Production Pipeline be? Every slider is a decision, and every decision is cognitive load. The line between "meaningful choice" and "tedious micromanagement" needs playtesting.
- Does the Approval Gauntlet work as a turn-based negotiation, a dialogue-tree system, or something hybrid? The feel matters enormously — it needs to feel like a conversation, not a menu.
- How does the Concept Forge prevent repetition across dozens of campaigns? The combinatorial space of tone, hook type, celebrity talent, and cultural risk needs to be large enough that the player rarely sees the same concept twice in a career.
- What is the right pacing for Super Bowl access? If the player can reach Super Bowl Sunday in year one, the stakes deflate too early. If it takes five years, the carrot is too distant. Year two or three feels like the sweet spot.

### Narrative Questions [NOVA]
- How much backstory do individual creatives need? The player should care when their best copywriter threatens to quit — but that care needs to emerge from shared history, not from reading a bio.
- Where is the line between "the client is an obstacle" and "the client is a character"? The best version of this game makes the player genuinely understand why the client is asking for the safe version, even as the player fights for the bold one.
- What is the agency's origin story? Does the player start as a scrappy startup or a mid-tier shop? The opening scenario shapes the entire emotional arc.
- How do we handle the post-9/11 tonal shift? The game is set in the early 2000s, and the advertising industry's response to September 11th was one of its most complex cultural moments. Ignoring it feels dishonest; centering it feels exploitative. The answer is probably environmental — the world changes around the player, and their response is expressed through the work they choose to make.

### Marketing Questions [HYPE]
- What is the announcement hook? The Super Bowl connection is the scroll-stopper: "A game about making the ads you actually want to watch." Announce in January, timed to real Super Bowl discourse.
- What is the demo scope? A single-year playthrough with two client accounts and one Super Bowl slot. Enough to experience the full loop: brief, team, concept, gauntlet, production, broadcast, reaction.
- Do we lean into the Mad Men comparison or the Game Dev Tycoon comparison? Both audiences exist. The answer is probably Mad Men for awareness (broader cultural recognition) and Game Dev Tycoon for conversion (genre familiarity for the Steam audience).
- What is the GIF? A split-screen showing an ad "airing" on the left and the America Reacts panel exploding on the right. The numbers moving. The memes spawning. The client calling. That is the five-second moment that sells this game.
- How does this look on a Steam capsule? The capsule art needs to communicate "advertising + management sim + the Super Bowl" instantly. A conference room seen through glass, storyboards on the wall, a TV screen showing a football game in the background, and the Upfront logo in bold Helvetica. Colors: amber, navy, Clio gold.

### Next Steps
1. Prototype the Approval Gauntlet as a standalone interaction. Get the feel of the negotiation right before building anything else. If the gauntlet is fun, the game works. If it is not, nothing else matters.
2. Build the Concept Forge on paper — define the combinatorial space of tones, hooks, talent, and risk levels. Verify that it produces enough variety for a 20-hour career.
3. Prototype Team Chemistry with four creatives and one brief. Test whether team composition meaningfully changes the output.
4. Design the Super Bowl Sunday sequence as a vertical slice: one ad, one reaction panel, one Monday Morning report. This is the spectacle moment and it needs to feel like an event.
5. Write five client archetypes (the safe corporate giant, the desperate startup, the legacy brand in decline, the trend-chasing challenger brand, the prestige luxury house) and test them against the Approval Gauntlet prototype.
6. Mood art: one key art piece of the agency bullpen. One UI mockup of the Approval Gauntlet. One storyboard-style mock ad. These are the assets that make the Steam page real.
7. Steam page goes live the week before the real Super Bowl. The cultural timing is too perfect to miss.

*This pitch document was generated by REED (Game Designer), NOVA (Narrative Designer), and HYPE (Marketing). The game lives or dies on one question: can the Approval Gauntlet make the player feel the real, stomach-churning tension of defending creative work to someone who is paying for it? If that mechanic sings, Upfront is the management sim the creative industry has been waiting to play about itself. If it doesn't, it's just another tycoon game with a fresh coat of paint. Find the gauntlet. Find the fun. Everything else follows.*
