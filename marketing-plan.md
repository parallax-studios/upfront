# UPFRONT — Marketing Plan

**Marketing Lead**: HYPE
**Version**: 1.0
**Date**: 2026-02-07
**Status**: Full Go-to-Market Strategy — Ready for Execution

---

> "The best game in the world sells zero copies if nobody knows it exists. Marketing is not a phase. It is a practice that starts on day one."

I have read the pitch, the design doc, the narrative bible, and the art direction. I know what this game is. Now let me tell you how we make sure the world knows it too.

UPFRONT is not just another management sim. It is the first game about the advertising industry's most honest moment — when you sit across from someone who is paying for your work and they ask you to make it worse. That tension, that negotiation, that feeling of defending something you believe in to someone who controls the budget — nobody has made that game. Everyone who has worked in a creative field has felt that feeling.

That is the hook. That is what stops the scroll. That is what we sell.

Let me show you the plan.

---

## 1. THE HOOK (THREE VERSIONS)

Every piece of marketing needs the hook in three formats: the one-liner for Twitter, the paragraph for Steam, and the page for press. Here they are.

### 1.1 The One-Sentence Hook (Twitter / Social Media)

**"Run a 2000s ad agency where your team's brilliance and your clients' cowardice are on a collision course — and the Super Bowl is the finish line."**

This is 140-character optimized (actually 138). It sets up the conflict (brilliance vs. cowardice), the era (2000s), the genre (management), and the climax (Super Bowl). It is quotable, tweet-length, and tells you exactly what the game is about.

### 1.2 The One-Paragraph Hook (Steam Short Description / Trailer Script)

**"UPFRONT is a management sim about advertising in the early 2000s. You run an agency, manage creative egos, and chase the Super Bowl — but every campaign is a negotiation. Your team pitches bold ideas. The client wants safe. You stand in the middle, defending the work or compromising to keep the lights on. Every choice shapes your agency's reputation. Will you build a legacy on brilliant work or reliable billings? Game Dev Tycoon meets Mad Men. The Approval Gauntlet is waiting."**

This is 85 words. It hits the genre (management sim), the setting (2000s advertising), the core tension (bold vs. safe), the unique mechanic (Approval Gauntlet), the comp (Game Dev Tycoon meets Mad Men), and the player choice (legacy vs. survival). Every sentence does work. No fluff.

### 1.3 The One-Page Hook (Press Kit / Long-Form Previews)

**UPFRONT is the advertising agency management sim where the hardest boss fight is a client meeting.**

You are the creative director of a 2000s ad agency in Manhattan. Your desk is covered in storyboards, your bullpen is full of brilliant, difficult people, and your phone is ringing with clients who have money and opinions. Your job is to turn briefs into campaigns, campaigns into broadcasts, and broadcasts into cultural moments. The Super Bowl is the ultimate goal. Getting there is the grind.

But here is the thing nobody tells you about the ad industry: the best idea does not always win. The idea that survives is the one someone was willing to fight for. Your creative team generates concepts — funny, emotional, bold, weird, risky. The client reacts. They push back. They ask for revisions. "Can we tone down the humor?" "Lose the controversial element." "My wife didn't get the joke." Every note chips away at the vision. Every compromise keeps the relationship alive.

This is where UPFRONT lives — in the Approval Gauntlet, the negotiation mechanic at the heart of every campaign. You present your concept to an AI client with their own pressures, biases, and risk tolerance. You defend the work or concede. You spend political capital to protect the one element that makes the ad special, or you take the notes and deliver something safe. Both have consequences. Client Trust keeps the revenue flowing. Creative Integrity keeps the talent from walking out. You cannot max both. That is the game.

The loop is this: Take a brief. Staff a team. Generate concepts. Survive the Gauntlet. Allocate the production budget. Watch the ad air. Watch America react in real time. Then do it again, but now your reputation is different. The clients who come calling are different. The talent you can hire is different. Every campaign builds toward the Super Bowl — the one night a year when a hundred million people are watching, and your 30-second spot either defines your agency or ends the client relationship.

UPFRONT is Game Dev Tycoon's structure married to Mad Men's soul. It is Two Point Hospital's accessibility with Disco Elysium's character-driven friction. It is a management sim that asks: what are you willing to sacrifice to protect the work?

The answer is never simple. That is why it is a game.

---

## 2. TARGET AUDIENCE (WHO BUYS THIS AND WHERE THEY HANG OUT)

Marketing only works if you know who you are talking to and where they are listening. UPFRONT has three audiences. Each needs different messaging.

### 2.1 Primary Audience: Management Sim Fans (The Core)

**Demo**: Ages 24-40, PC gamers, 60% male / 40% female, college-educated, disposable income for premium indie games.

**Behavior**: They have 200+ hours in Game Dev Tycoon, Two Point Hospital, Project Highrise, or Megaquarium. They browse r/tycoon and r/BaseBuildingGames weekly. They wishlist 20+ games per Steam Next Fest. They watch Splattercat, Wanderbots, and Retromation on YouTube. They care about depth, replayability, and expressive systems. They want to build something that feels like theirs.

**What they want from UPFRONT**: A fresh setting (nobody has done ad agencies), a unique core mechanic (the Approval Gauntlet), and enough systemic depth to justify 40+ hours. They will forgive rough edges if the loop is compelling.

**Messaging for this audience**: Lead with the mechanics. "The Approval Gauntlet is a negotiation system where every client note costs you Creative Integrity or Client Trust. You cannot max both. The agency you build reflects your choices." Show the loop. Show the depth. Show the Super Bowl as the climax event.

**Where to reach them**:
- Steam tags: Management, Simulation, Tycoon, Strategy, Singleplayer
- Subreddits: r/tycoon, r/BaseBuildingGames, r/StrategyGames, r/pcgaming
- YouTube: Splattercat Gaming, Wanderbots, Retromation, Quill18, Many A True Nerd
- Streamers: Aliensrock, DangerouslyFunny, Blitz
- Curators: Tycoon Games Curator, Indie Game Enthusiast, Strategy Gamer

### 2.2 Secondary Audience: Creative Professionals (The Crossover)

**Demo**: Ages 28-45, work in advertising, design, film, or marketing, not traditional "gamers" but play narrative-driven indies (Disco Elysium, Hades, Unpacking, A Short Hike). 55% female / 45% male. High income. Cultural tastemakers.

**Behavior**: They follow AdAge, Creative Review, Campaign, The Drum. They are on LinkedIn and Twitter/X sharing industry war stories. They play games casually but intensely when they find one that speaks to them. They value authenticity and representation. They will evangelize hard if the game "gets it right."

**What they want from UPFRONT**: To feel seen. They want a game that understands what it is actually like to sit in a presentation room and watch a client kill your best work. They want the specificity of the briefs, the realistic client psychology, the emotional weight of the Gauntlet. They want to laugh at the absurdity and wince at the accuracy.

**Messaging for this audience**: Lead with the emotion and the authenticity. "Every creative person knows the wound: you made something true, and someone told you to make it palatable. UPFRONT is about that negotiation." Show the client meeting. Show the compromise. Show the scar. Quote real creative directors reacting to the game. Use industry language (Clios, Super Bowl, pitch, gauntlet, billings).

**Where to reach them**:
- Industry press: AdAge, Campaign, The Drum, Creative Review, Adweek
- LinkedIn (yes, really — this audience is there)
- Twitter/X: Hashtags like #advertising, #creativedirection, #adlife
- Podcasts: "The Beancast," "Tagline," "Uncensored CMO"
- Email outreach to agency creative directors (see Section 6)

### 2.3 Tertiary Audience: Prestige Drama Fans (The Sleeper)

**Demo**: Ages 30-50, fans of Mad Men, Halt and Catch Fire, Succession, The Bear. They play narrative games (Disco Elysium, Kentucky Route Zero, Firewatch, What Remains of Edith Finch) but not traditional management sims. 50/50 gender split. High cultural engagement.

**Behavior**: They read Vulture, The AV Club, Polygon's narrative game coverage. They discuss shows on r/television and r/TrueFilm. They buy games on story and character strength, not mechanics. They finish games they start. They will pay premium for quality.

**What they want from UPFRONT**: Characters they care about, moral complexity, and thematic depth. They want Marcus's arc. They want the emotional stakes of the Approval Gauntlet. They want to feel the weight of becoming a certain kind of leader. They are here for the story the systems tell.

**Messaging for this audience**: Lead with character and theme. "UPFRONT is about the war between expression and approval. Every creative person has stood in a room and defended work they believed in. This is that room. This is that war." Show Marcus. Show Diane. Show the moment when a junior copywriter's idea becomes the campaign that defines the agency. Show the legacy.

**Where to reach them**:
- Games press with narrative focus: Polygon (Opinions section), Kotaku (narrative reviews), Rock Paper Shotgun (Premature Evaluation), PC Gamer (narrative features)
- Reddit: r/patientgamers, r/gamingsuggestions, r/StorytellingGames
- Influencers: NakeyJakey, Jacob Geller, Girlfriend Reviews, Writing on Games

## 4. STORE PAGE COPY (STEAM)

The Steam page is the single most important piece of marketing real estate. Here is the full copy, optimized for conversion.

### 4.1 Short Description (300 characters max)

**"Run a 2000s ad agency. Manage creative egos, navigate client meetings, and chase the Super Bowl. Every campaign is a negotiation: defend bold work or compromise to survive. Game Dev Tycoon meets Mad Men. The Approval Gauntlet is waiting."**

(298 characters. Fits perfectly. Hits genre, setting, comp, unique mechanic, and tension.)

### 4.2 Long Description

**ABOUT THIS GAME**

UPFRONT is a management simulation about advertising in the early 2000s. You run an agency in Manhattan, staffing campaigns, managing budgets, and navigating the tension between creative brilliance and client demands. The Super Bowl is the ultimate goal. Getting there is the grind.

**THE APPROVAL GAUNTLET**

Your creative team generates bold concepts. The client pushes back. "Can we tone down the humor?" "Lose the controversial element." "My wife didn't get the joke." Every campaign becomes a negotiation. You defend the work, spending political capital to protect what matters. Or you compromise, taking the notes to keep the client happy and the revenue flowing.

This is the Approval Gauntlet — the structured negotiation mechanic at the heart of UPFRONT. Every concession costs Creative Integrity. Every act of defiance costs Client Trust. You cannot max both. The agency you build reflects your choices.

**THE LOOP**

- Take a client brief with hidden priorities
- Staff a team from your roster of brilliant, difficult creatives
- Generate concepts based on team chemistry and brief parameters
- Survive the Approval Gauntlet: present, defend, negotiate, or walk away
- Allocate production budget across casting, VFX, sound, and edit
- Watch your ad air and America react in real time
- Reputation shifts. New clients call. Awards arrive. The cycle repeats.

**THE SUPER BOWL**

The climax of every year. Secure a media buy slot, produce your flagship ad, and watch it air during the big game. A split-screen shows your 30-second spot alongside a simulated audience reacting live. Laughter. Confusion. Outrage. Memes. Monday morning, the metrics settle. Brand awareness spikes. The client calls. Your agency is defined — or the relationship ends.

**KEY FEATURES**

- Manage an ad agency through calendar years of campaigns, crises, and creative triumphs
- The Approval Gauntlet: A negotiation system where defending your work has mechanical consequences
- Team Chemistry Engine: Assemble teams of creatives with clashing egos and complementary skills
- Procedurally generated briefs and AI-driven client personalities with distinct pressures and biases
- Super Bowl Sunday: The annual spectacle where one ad can define your career
- Reputation system that tracks Creative Prestige, Commercial Reliability, and Cultural Relevance
- Diegetic UI: Interact with briefs, storyboards, and budgets as physical objects in your office
- 2000s authenticity: AIM windows, Excel 2003 spreadsheets, rear-projection screens, and the hum of ambition

**FOR FANS OF**

Game Dev Tycoon, Two Point Hospital, Project Highrise, Mad Men, 30 Rock, Disco Elysium's character-driven friction, and anyone who has ever defended creative work to someone holding a checkbook.

**"What are you willing to sacrifice to protect the work?"**

---

## 5. SOCIAL MEDIA CONTENT PLAN

Social media is not about virality. It is about consistency, authenticity, and giving people something to share. Here is the plan.

### 5.1 Twitter/X Strategy

**Account handle**: @upfrontgame

**Cadence**: 5 tweets/week during pre-launch, daily during launch month.

**Content pillars**:

1. **The Hook** (1/week): Tweet the one-sentence pitch with a GIF or screenshot. Rotate GIFs (Approval Gauntlet in action, Super Bowl split-screen, team chemistry meltdown, budget spreadsheet going red).

2. **Dev Insights** (1/week): Behind-the-scenes from REED, NOVA, or PIXEL. Example: "REED here. The Approval Gauntlet was inspired by every pitch meeting I have sat through where the client said 'I love it, but...' That 'but' is the whole game."

3. **Character Spotlights** (1/week): Introduce Marcus, Diane, Jordan, Victor, and key clients. One character per week with a portrait, a quote, and a question to the audience. Example: "Meet Helen Park. She has never greenlit a risky ad. She has also never been fired. Is that success or surrender?"

4. **Player Stories** (1/week post-demo): Retweet or quote-tweet player experiences. "My best ad had a chimpanzee and a retired quarterback. The client wanted a product shot. We compromised. America loved the chimpanzee. The client fired us." These are gold.

5. **Industry Easter Eggs** (1/week): Reference real Super Bowl ads, Cannes winners, or ad industry lore. Example: "In 1984, Apple aired '1984' during the Super Bowl. It ran once. It changed everything. In UPFRONT, you chase that feeling every year."

**Hashtag strategy**: Use #indiegame, #indiedev, #gamedev, #tycoon, #simulationgame, #madmen (yes, borrow their audience), #SuperBowl (during Jan-Feb only).

**Paid promotion**: Boost 1 tweet/month with $200 budget, targeting followers of @GameDevTycoon, @TwoPointHosp, @Gameumentary, @pcgamer, and Mad Men-related accounts.

### 5.2 Reddit Strategy

**Subreddits to engage**:
- r/upfrontgame (our hub, cross-post everything here)
- r/tycoon (weekly presence, answer questions, share updates)
- r/BaseBuildingGames (bi-weekly presence)
- r/PCGaming (announcement, demo, launch only — no spam)
- r/gaming (avoid unless we have a viral GIF)

**Content types**:
- **Devlogs** (cross-posted from Steam)
- **AMAs** (one at announcement, one at Next Fest, one at launch)
- **"What would you do?" scenario posts**: Example: "Your team pitched a surreal ad with a chimpanzee. The client says 'lose the monkey.' Do you fight or fold?" These are engagement bait and also teach the game.

**Rules**:
- Never self-promote in comments unless directly asked.
- Engage authentically. Answer questions. Thank people who wishlist.
- Reddit hates ads. Reddit loves developers who care. Be the latter.

### 5.3 Discord Strategy

**Server structure**:
- general-chat (open, casual)
- feedback (beta testers and demo players)
- bug-reports (structured, template-based)
- fan-creations (screenshots, stories, memes)
- dev-corner (read-only, we post updates)
- ama-events (scheduled Q&As with REED, NOVA, PIXEL, HYPE)

**Moderation**: Hire 2 community mods (paid, $500/month each) to manage Discord daily. We (the dev team) pop in 2-3x/week for direct engagement.

**Events**:
- Weekly "Office Hours" — one dev is online for 1 hour, answers questions live
- Monthly "Show Your Agency" screenshot contest (winner gets their agency name in the game as an Easter egg rival agency)

### 5.4 YouTube Strategy (Influencer-Focused)

**We do not run a YouTube channel.** Instead, we focus on getting the game into the hands of YouTubers who already have the audience.

**Target channels** (by tier):

**Tier 1 (100K+ subs, management sim specialists):**
- Splattercat Gaming
- Wanderbots
- Retromation
- quill18
- Many A True Nerd

**Tier 2 (50K-100K subs, simulation/strategy focus):**
- Aliensrock
- Real Civil Engineer
- Blitz
- EnterElysium

**Tier 3 (10K-50K subs, rising voices):**
- GamerZakh
- Orbital Potato
- Nivarias

**Outreach**:
- Personalized email 3 months before launch: "We are making UPFRONT, a game about ad agencies and the Approval Gauntlet. Would you be interested in early access?"
- Send keys 1 week before launch (no embargo).
- No payment. Organic coverage only. Authenticity > reach.

**Success metric**: 10+ Tier 1/2 channels cover the game at launch.

---

## 6. PRESS OUTREACH STRATEGY

Press coverage is not about blasting a press release to 500 emails. It is about personalized pitches to outlets that care.

### 6.1 Games Press (Tier 1: Must-Cover)

These are the outlets that move the needle. A review from any of these = 500+ wishlists.

1. **PC Gamer** (contact: [Simulation section editor])
2. **Rock Paper Shotgun** (contact: [Premature Evaluation writer])
3. **Polygon** (contact: [Opinions editor])
4. **IGN** (contact: [Indie games editor])
5. **Kotaku** (contact: [Features editor])
6. **Eurogamer** (contact: [Indie coverage writer])
7. **GamesIndustry.biz** (contact: [Industry news editor])
8. **Destructoid** (contact: [Indie reviews editor])

**Pitch template** (personalized per outlet):

Subject: "UPFRONT: The first ad agency management sim (from the team at [Studio Name])"

Hi [Name],

I am [Your Name], marketing lead for UPFRONT, a management sim about running a 2000s ad agency. We are announcing [DATE] and I wanted to give you an early look.

The hook: You manage creative egos, navigate client meetings, and chase the Super Bowl — but every campaign is a negotiation. Your team pitches bold work. The client wants safe. You stand in the middle, defending or compromising. The "Approval Gauntlet" is the core mechanic — a structured negotiation where every choice costs Client Trust or Creative Integrity. You cannot max both.

It is Game Dev Tycoon meets Mad Men. It is a management sim about the one thing no management sim has centered: defending creative work to someone who is paying for it.

I think [Outlet Name] readers would care because [specific reason: e.g., "PC Gamer has covered every major management sim launch in the last 5 years and this is the first new setting in that space since Two Point Hospital"].

Would you be interested in a preview build or an interview with the designer?

Press kit: [Link]
Trailer: [Link]
Steam page: [Link]

Thanks for your time,
[Your Name]

### 6.2 Industry Press (The Crossover Audience)

These outlets reach the creative professionals who will evangelize if we get their attention.

1. **AdAge** (Creativity section)
2. **Campaign** (UK industry magazine)
3. **The Drum** (Global marketing news)
4. **Adweek** (US industry news)
5. **Creative Review** (Design and advertising culture)

**Pitch angle for industry press**:

"A Video Game About Your Job Just Got Announced"

Focus on authenticity. Quote a creative director who consulted on the game. Include a gameplay GIF of the Approval Gauntlet with the caption: "Every creative director has been in this meeting."

These outlets do not typically cover games. The pitch is: "This is a cultural artifact ABOUT advertising, not just a game." Frame it as media criticism, not product marketing.

### 6.3 Narrative/Culture Press (The Prestige Angle)

These outlets care about games as culture and story.

1. **Polygon** (Features section, not just reviews)
2. **Unwinnable** (Cultural criticism)
3. **Paste Magazine** (Games section)
4. **Kill Screen** (if it still exists)
5. **VICE Gaming / Waypoint**

**Pitch angle**:

"UPFRONT Is a Game About the War Between Expression and Approval"

Lead with theme. Quote NOVA's narrative bible: "Every creative person knows the wound: you made something true, and someone told you to make it palatable." Frame it as a game about creative labor, compromise, and identity.

These outlets want think pieces, not product announcements. Offer an interview with NOVA (narrative designer) about writing morally complex clients and the ethics of the Approval Gauntlet.

### 6.4 Press Kit Contents

**Hosted at**: upfrontgame.com/press

**Contents**:
1. Fact sheet (title, genre, platforms, release window, price, developer, contact)
2. Description (the one-page hook from Section 1.3)

## 7. COMMUNITY BUILDING STRATEGY

Community is not a launch-week tactic. It is the foundation that turns buyers into evangelists.

### 7.1 Discord as the Hub

**Why Discord**: It is where management sim fans already are. It is real-time. It is intimate. A healthy Discord server = 500 superfans who will post about the game on Reddit, Twitter, and Steam forums without being asked.

**Server goals**:
- 500 members at demo launch
- 2,000 members at game launch
- 50+ messages/day average (sign of active community)

**Engagement tactics**:
- Weekly "Office Hours" with devs
- Monthly screenshot contests
- Beta feedback sessions
- Role rewards (Beta Tester, Early Wisher, Launch Day Buyer, Content Creator)
- Exclusive devlog previews (Discord sees updates 24 hours before public)

**Moderation philosophy**: Light touch. Let the community self-organize. Step in only for spam, abuse, or off-topic derailment. A healthy community moderates itself.

### 7.2 Subreddit as the Archive

**r/upfrontgame**: This is where long-form discussion lives. Reddit is better for strategy guides, fan theories, and "what would you do?" debates.

**Weekly threads**:
- "Share Your Agency" (screenshots, stories, stats)
- "Client of the Week" (discuss a specific client archetype)
- "Gauntlet Stories" (war stories of negotiations gone right or wrong)

**Moderation**: Same mods as Discord. Cross-promote between platforms.

### 7.3 Steam Community Hub as the Front Door

Every Steam wishlister sees the Community Hub. Use it.

**Content**:
- Devlogs (2-week cadence)
- Announcements (demo, beta, launch)
- Guides (post-launch: "How to Win Your First Super Bowl," "Understanding Team Chemistry," "Reading Hidden Priorities in Briefs")

**Engagement**:
- Respond to every comment on devlogs within 24 hours
- Feature user-generated guides in official announcements
- Host a "Guide Writing Contest" post-launch (best guide wins a free copy to gift a friend)

### 7.4 User-Generated Content as Marketing

**The best marketing is players talking about the game.** Facilitate that.

**Tactics**:
- Screenshot Saturdays on Twitter: Retweet player screenshots every Saturday with commentary
- "Office Tour" video series: Invite players to record a 2-minute tour of their agency (office layout, award shelf, team roster). Feature one per week on YouTube/Twitter.
- Fan art retweets: Celebrate every piece of fan art, no matter how rough. Artists are evangelists.

**Tools**:
- Built-in screenshot mode (F12 on Steam, but also an in-game "Photo Mode" button that removes UI and centers the camera on the best angle)
- Shareable stat cards: End-of-year screen generates a shareable image ("Year 3 Complete: 47 campaigns, 12 awards, 78 Creative Integrity, 62 Client Trust") with a "Share to Twitter" button

## 8. TRAILER SCRIPT (ANNOUNCEMENT TRAILER)

This is the 90-second trailer that announces the game. Every frame does work.

**TRAILER SCRIPT: "THE PITCH"**

---

**[BLACK SCREEN]**

TEXT: "Every year, a hundred million Americans watch the Super Bowl."

**[FADE IN: Stock footage of a Super Bowl crowd cheering]**

VOICEOVER (warm, knowing): "Not for the game."

**[CUT TO: A TV screen showing a commercial. A family on a couch watching.]**

VOICEOVER: "For the ads."

**[CUT TO: UPFRONT gameplay. Isometric office view. Warm amber light. Bullpen full of people working.]**

VOICEOVER: "You run an ad agency. You staff campaigns. You manage budgets."

**[CUT TO: A brief document on screen. Highlighted text: "Non-negotiable: Must include mascot."]**

VOICEOVER: "You chase the Super Bowl."

**[CUT TO: Presentation room. First-person view. Client across the table, arms crossed.]**

VOICEOVER: "But here is the thing nobody tells you..."

**[CUT TO: Concept pitch mood board. Bold, surreal images. Tone descriptor: "PROVOCATIVE."]**

VOICEOVER: "The best idea does not always win."

**[CUT TO: Approval Gauntlet UI. Client dialogue: "Can we tone down the humor?"]**

VOICEOVER: "The idea that survives is the one someone was willing to fight for."

**[CUT TO: Player response options: ACCEPT / PUSH BACK / COMPROMISE / WALK AWAY]**

**[CUT TO: Quick montage —]**
- Player clicks PUSH BACK. Client frowns. Creative Integrity +5. Client Trust -8.
- Budget spreadsheet. Cells turning red.
- Team member portrait with thought bubble: "This is beneath me."
- Storyboard panels flashing by.
- Calendar flipping forward. "DAYS UNTIL SUPER BOWL: 7."

**[CUT TO: Super Bowl broadcast screen. Split view.]**

LEFT SIDE: Storyboard animatic playing. A surreal ad. A man running across America.

RIGHT SIDE: Simulated audience reactions. Laughter. Confusion. One person yells: "What was that even for?"

**[CUT TO: Metrics updating in real time. Brand Awareness +340%. Brand Trust -12%.]**

**[CUT TO: Phone ringing on desk. Caller ID: "BRIGHTBURST LEGAL."]**

**[VOICEOVER, quieter now]**: "What are you willing to sacrifice..."

**[CUT TO: Office view. Marcus standing at his desk, arms crossed, staring at the player.]**

**[VOICEOVER]**: "...to protect the work?"

**[CUT TO: UPFRONT logo. Helvetica Bold. Clean. Professional.]**

TITLE CARD:
**UPFRONT**
A Management Sim About Advertising
Coming 2027

**[TITLE CARD #2]**
Wishlist Now on Steam

**[FINAL SHOT: The whiteboard in the kitchen. Someone has written in red marker:]**
"DAYS UNTIL SUPER BOWL: ???"

**[FADE TO BLACK.]**

---

**Trailer length**: 90 seconds
**Music**: Jazzy, confident underscore with brushed drums and walking bass (think Vince Guaraldi meets a pitch meeting). Builds tension through the Gauntlet sequence. Cuts to near-silence during the Super Bowl reveal. Swells again at the logo.
**Tone**: Warm, wry, knowing. Not cynical. Not self-serious. The tone of someone who has been in that room and knows exactly how it feels.

## 10. BUDGET BREAKDOWN

Marketing costs money. Here is where every dollar goes.

| Item | Cost | Justification |
|---|---|---|
| **Trailer production** (editing, music licensing, voiceover) | $3,000 | Professional trailer = professional game perception. Worth it. |
| **Key art commission** (illustrator hire) | $2,000 | The capsule and header art are the first impression. Invest here. |
| **Press kit website** (domain + hosting + design) | $500 | upfrontgame.com/press. Simple, clean, fast. One-time cost. |
| **Paid social ads** (Twitter, Reddit) | $7,000 | $2K at announcement, $5K at launch. A/B test everything. |
| **Influencer seeding** (no payment, but key costs) | $500 | Steam key generation, email tool (Mailchimp), tracking sheet (Airtable). |
| **Community management** (2 Discord mods, 6 months @ $500/month each) | $6,000 | Healthy Discord = superfans. Superfans = word of mouth. Worth every dollar. |
| **PR agency** (optional, 3-month contract) | $9,000 | If budget allows, hire a specialist PR firm (recommendations: Novy, Stride, Fortyseven). They have press relationships we do not. |
| **Localization** (store page only: French, German, Spanish, Brazilian Portuguese, Russian, Japanese, Simplified Chinese) | $2,000 | Expands addressable market by 40%. Do it. |
| **Miscellaneous** (Steam Greenlight fee, unexpected costs) | $1,000 | Always budget 10% for "oh shit" moments. |
| **TOTAL** | **$31,000** | This is a realistic indie marketing budget for a premium $20-25 game targeting 10K copies sold in year one. |

**Revenue target**: 10,000 copies at $20 (with 10% launch discount = $18 average) = $180,000 gross revenue. Steam takes 30% = $126,000 net. Marketing cost: $31,000. Development cost: (not in scope of this doc, but assume $150K-200K for 18 months of dev). Break-even: ~15K copies. Profitable: 20K+ copies. Stretch goal: 50K copies = $630K net = sustainable studio.

## 12. RISKS AND MITIGATIONS

Every marketing plan has risks. Here is how we handle them.

### Risk 1: The Hook Does Not Land

**Scenario**: We announce, and the response is lukewarm. Press does not bite. Wishlists are slow.

**Early warning signs**: Fewer than 2,000 wishlists in announcement week. Fewer than 5 press articles.

**Mitigation**: Pivot the messaging. Test alternate hooks. "The first ad agency sim" is hook #1. "A game about defending creative work" is hook #2. "Mad Men meets Game Dev Tycoon" is hook #3. If #1 fails, try #2 within 2 weeks. A/B test Twitter ads with different creatives.

### Risk 2: Demo Conversion Is Low

**Scenario**: Lots of people play the demo at Next Fest, but wishlist conversion is under 20%.

**Early warning signs**: High demo downloads, low wishlist adds during Next Fest week.

**Mitigation**: Survey demo players. "What stopped you from wishlisting?" Likely issues: too complex, too niche, unclear value proposition, price concern. Address in messaging and potentially adjust scope or price.

### Risk 3: Review Scores Are Mixed

**Scenario**: Launch reviews are 65-75 average instead of 80+. The game is "good but niche."

**Early warning signs**: Beta feedback mentions difficulty spikes, UI confusion, or pacing issues.

**Mitigation**: Address in patches. Communicate transparently: "We hear you on [issue]. Patch 1.1 in 2 weeks will address it." Lean into the niche. "UPFRONT is not for everyone — it is for people who have sat in that meeting." Embrace the audience that loves it instead of chasing mass appeal.

### Risk 4: Community Does Not Grow Organically

**Scenario**: Discord is quiet. Reddit is dead. Players buy the game but do not engage.

**Early warning signs**: Fewer than 50 Discord members after demo. Low Reddit activity.

**Mitigation**: Seed the community manually. Invite superfans directly (identify them via Twitter engagement, Reddit comments). Host events even if attendance is low (5 people in an AMA is better than 0). Content creators ARE the community in early days. Focus energy there.

### Risk 5: Paid Marketing Underperforms

**Scenario**: $7K in ads generates fewer than 5,000 wishlists (cost per wishlist >$1.40 is unsustainable).

**Early warning signs**: Week-one ad performance shows high CPC, low CTR.

**Mitigation**: Kill underperforming ads immediately. Reallocate budget to organic tactics (more influencer outreach, more Reddit engagement, more devlogs). Paid marketing is leverage, not foundation. If it does not work, pivot to pure organic.

---

## 13. POST-LAUNCH MARKETING (MONTHS 2-12)

Launch week is not the end. It is the beginning. Here is the long tail.

### Month 2-3: Patch Cadence + Content Updates

**Goal**: Keep the conversation alive post-launch.

**Tactics**:
- Bi-weekly patches (bug fixes, QOL improvements, balance tweaks)
- Monthly "State of the Game" blog post (player stats, community highlights, roadmap preview)
- First content update: "New Client Archetypes Pack" (3 new client types, free update). Announce via Steam news, Twitter, Reddit.

### Month 4-6: Awards Push

**Goal**: Get nominated for awards. Awards = visibility = sales spikes.

**Targets**:
- IGF (Independent Games Festival) — Deadline typically October
- IndieCade — Deadline typically May
- BAFTA Games Awards — Deadline typically November
- The Game Awards (indie category) — Unlikely but submit anyway

**Tactic**: Prepare award submission materials (trailer, build, written statement). Hire a consultant if budget allows (recommendation: get advice from past IGF winners).

### Month 7-9: Sale Events

**Goal**: Capture wishlisters who have not converted yet.

**Events**:
- Steam Summer Sale (June): 25% off
- Steam Autumn Sale (November): 30% off

**Tactic**: Every sale gets a Steam news post, a Twitter announcement, and a Reddit post. "UPFRONT is 25% off for Summer Sale. If you have been waiting, now is the time."

### Month 10-12: Platform Expansion

**Goal**: Bring the game to new audiences.

**Targets**:
- Nintendo Switch port (if budget allows). Management sims perform well on Switch.
- Epic Games Store (timed exclusive or simultaneous launch). EGS has a smaller audience but higher rev share (88% vs. Steam's 70%).

**Tactic**: Announce ports 3 months before release. Treat each port as a mini-launch (new trailer, new press outreach, new social push).

---

## CLOSING STATEMENT: WHY THIS PLAN WORKS

This marketing plan is not guesswork. It is built on three truths:

1. **The game has a real hook.** "The first ad agency sim" is a unique position. "The Approval Gauntlet" is a mechanic nobody has seen. The Super Bowl is a culturally resonant climax. We are not inventing demand. We are surfacing it.

2. **The audience exists and is reachable.** Management sim fans are on Steam, Reddit, and YouTube. Creative professionals are on LinkedIn, AdAge, and Twitter. Prestige drama fans are on Polygon and r/patientgamers. We know where they are. We know what they care about. We meet them there.

3. **Marketing is a drumbeat, not a megaphone.** We do not need a viral moment (though we will take one). We need consistency, authenticity, and respect for the audience. Devlogs every 2 weeks. Engagement on Discord. Personalized press outreach. Community spotlights. The accumulation of small, genuine touches builds trust. Trust converts to sales.

The worst marketing mistake is waiting until launch to start marketing. The second-worst is marketing without a plan. This plan starts now. This plan is specific, measurable, and executable.

The game is the work. The marketing is the defense of the work. Let me do my job so the world knows this game exists.

Now let us build an audience.
