# UPFRONT — Narrative Bible

*Compiled by NOVA, Narrative Designer*

*"This game is not about advertising. It is about the moment you look at something you made and decide whether to defend it or let it die. Advertising is just the most honest arena for that fight — because in advertising, the person who wants to change your work is also the person writing the check. Every mechanic in this game tells a story about that negotiation. Every number on the screen is a scar or a trophy. The question is: which ones does the player carry home?"*

## 1. THE WORLD'S WOUND

### Defining Event

The year is 2003. The dot-com bubble has burst, scattering the remains of a hundred million-dollar promises across the cultural landscape like confetti from a party that ended in a fire. Television survived. Television always survives. And the throne room of television is the Super Bowl — the one night a year when a hundred million Americans sit down and *choose* to watch commercials. The advertising industry is bruised but standing, and it is standing in a very specific place: the last moment in history when a 30-second television spot can change the culture, and everyone in the business knows it, even if they cannot say it out loud.

The defining event is not a single catastrophe. It is a slow realization — a tide going out. The internet is rising. Attention is fragmenting. The 30-second spot, the art form these people have built their careers and identities around, is beginning to die. Nobody admits this in 2003. But everyone feels it. The urgency that drives every pitch meeting, every late night in the edit suite, every screaming match in the presentation room — that urgency is not just about this quarter's billings. It is about legacy. It is about making something that matters before the window closes.

What does the player FEEL here? They feel the electricity of a world that doesn't know it's ending. They feel the romance of fluorescent lights at midnight, of burnt coffee and brilliant ideas scrawled on whiteboards, of a profession that is simultaneously ridiculous and profound. The wound is temporal: *this cannot last, and the people inside it are working too hard to notice.*

### Central Tension

**Art versus Commerce — with no safe ground between them.**

Every person in the agency exists on a spectrum between two truths that cannot coexist:

- *The best way to sell something is to make people feel something real.*
- *The person paying you does not want to feel — they want to sell.*

The cynics and the romantics share the same open-plan office. The account executive who cares only about billings sits ten feet from the art director who still believes a 30-second spot can be cinema. The creative director who won a Clio last year is presenting to a client who has never heard of the Clios. These people need each other. They also cannot understand each other. The world cracks along this line — and the player walks the crack, one brief at a time.

Where does the world crack? It cracks in the presentation room. It cracks when a creative director says "trust me" and a client says "show me the data." It cracks when a copywriter writes a line that makes the whole room go quiet and the brand manager says "can we make it more on-brand?" It cracks every single day, in every single agency, in every single city where people make things for other people's money.

### The Big Lie

**"If you make great work, the right people will recognize it."**

This is the lie the industry tells its young. It is the lie that keeps art directors working until midnight and copywriters filling notebooks on the subway. It is a beautiful lie, and it is almost true — which makes it more dangerous than a complete falsehood.

The truth is: great work dies in presentation rooms every day. Great work gets killed by nervous clients, by quarterly earnings pressure, by focus groups of people who were paid forty dollars to have opinions. The work that survives is not always the best work — it is the work that found the right defender at the right moment in the right room. Talent is necessary. Talent is not sufficient. The missing variable is *advocacy* — the willingness to fight for work, to spend political capital, to risk the client relationship because you believe in the thirty seconds you are trying to protect.

The player learns this lie the hard way. Their first great concept will be killed. Their first safe concept will succeed. And then they must decide: do they keep making safe work, or do they learn to fight?

### Texture

The world smells like burnt Starbucks coffee and dry-erase markers. It sounds like muffled arguments through glass conference room walls, the rhythmic clacking of keyboards in the bullpen, a ringing desk phone that nobody picks up because everyone is in a meeting. It feels like the specific exhaustion of 11 PM on a Wednesday when the pitch is Thursday morning and the deck is not done — a tiredness that is also somehow exhilarating, because the work might be good, and if the work is good, nothing else matters.

The light is fluorescent in the hallways and warm amber through the west-facing windows at golden hour. Presentation rooms have that particular stillness of spaces designed for judgment. Edit suites glow blue. The kitchen whiteboard is a living document of anxiety: "DAYS UNTIL SUPER BOWL: 47" written in red expo marker, the countdown updated every morning by someone who never signs their name.

Desks are cluttered with printed-out storyboards, half-drunk bottles of water, framed photos of award-winning campaigns, and at least one stress ball shaped like a product the agency no longer represents. The Aeron chairs squeak. The Herman Miller desks are covered in Post-it notes. Somewhere, always, someone is arguing about a font.

## 2. WORLD-BUILDING

### Geography

**The Agency** is the entire world. The player rarely leaves it, and they do not need to. The agency is a mid-rise floor in Manhattan — glass walls, open-plan bullpen, private offices for senior staff, and a series of specialized rooms that function as the game's interactive zones:

- **The Bullpen**: The creative heartland. Rows of desks where copywriters, art directors, and designers work. The energy here is chaotic and generative — Post-it storms on walls, reference images pinned everywhere, the low-grade hum of creative argument. This is where concepts are born and teams are managed. *What does the player feel here? Possibility. Potential. The electricity of people who are thinking hard.*

- **The Presentation Room**: The gladiatorial arena. A long table, a rear-projection screen, uncomfortable chairs arranged in judgment. This is where the Approval Gauntlet happens — where concepts live or die. The room has a particular tension even when empty: it remembers every killed idea, every standing ovation, every client who said "I love it" and every client who said "go back to the drawing board." *What does the player feel here? Vulnerability. Stakes. The weight of a room that decides things.*

- **The Edit Suite**: A dark, cool cave of monitors and mixing boards. The place where approved concepts become finished ads. The light is always blue. The air is always cold. The people who work here speak a language of timecodes and color grades. *What does the player feel here? Craft. Precision. The satisfaction of something taking shape.*

- **The Corner Office**: The player's domain. A glass-walled room with a view of the skyline. The desk is covered in whatever the player's career has generated: framed awards, client thank-you notes, a stress ball, a bottle of something expensive that a client sent after a successful campaign. This room is the player's mirror — its contents change based on their choices. *What does the player feel here? Ownership. Reflection. "I built this."*

- **The Lobby**: The agency's public face. Framed award-winning campaigns on the walls, a reception desk, the agency's logo. Clients see this first. Recruits see this first. It is a curated version of the truth. A simulated news ticker and cultural feed run here, telegraphing trends and cultural shifts. *What does the player feel here? Reputation. The difference between what you show the world and what you are.*

- **The Kitchen**: The only democratic space. Everyone comes here — junior copywriters, senior partners, account executives, the IT guy. The whiteboard is the emotional pulse of the agency: Super Bowl countdowns, birthday announcements, passive-aggressive notes about stolen lunches, and occasionally a piece of genuine creative inspiration scrawled at 2 AM by someone who couldn't sleep. *What does the player feel here? Humanity. Intimacy. Reminder that this is a place full of people, not just a machine that makes ads.*

### History

The agency exists in a specific historical moment, and that moment has weight:

- **1999-2000**: The dot-com gold rush. Advertising agencies gorged on absurd budgets from internet companies that had no revenue and infinite ambition. Super Bowl XXXIV (2000) featured seventeen dot-com ads. Agencies doubled their headcount. Money was confetti.

- **2001**: The twin collapses. The dot-com bubble bursts. Then September 11th. The advertising industry faces an existential crisis — not just economic, but tonal. How do you sell things in a world that is grieving? The industry responds with a wave of sincerity that feels both genuine and calculated. Patriotic ads. Emotional ads. Ads that say nothing about the product and everything about feelings. Some of these are the best ads ever made. Some are the most cynical. The line between the two is invisible.

- **2002-2003**: The recovery, uneasy and incomplete. Television advertising budgets stabilize but do not return to dot-com heights. The Super Bowl remains the pinnacle, but the cost of a 30-second spot keeps climbing. Agencies are leaner, hungrier, and more political. The survivors are the ones who kept their best people and their biggest clients. The dead are the ones who chased dot-com money and had nothing when it evaporated.

- **2003 onward (the game's timeline)**: The player enters a world that is rebuilding with an undercurrent of dread. The internet is not yet the primary advertising medium, but it is growing. Every year, the cultural landscape shifts: reality TV reshapes what audiences consider authentic, the Iraq War divides the country and complicates any ad that touches patriotism, and the first YouTube video is only two years away. The player does not know this. But the world is tilting, and the work they make will either ride the wave or be swallowed by it.

### Culture

**The Agency Ecosystem** is a constellation of competing value systems forced to coexist:

- **Creatives** (Creative Directors, Copywriters, Art Directors): They believe in the work. They measure success in originality, craft, and cultural impact. They want to win Clios and make ads people remember. They will work eighty-hour weeks for a concept they believe in and phone it in for one they don't. Their currency is respect — from peers, from the industry, from the culture at large.

- **Account Management** (Account Executives, Client Services): They believe in relationships. They measure success in client retention, revenue growth, and billings. They are the translators between the creative department and the client — and they are resented by both sides for it. Their currency is trust — from clients who know they will be heard, and from creatives who know they will be protected.

- **Production** (Producers, Editors, Post-Production): They believe in execution. They measure success in whether the finished product matches the ambition of the concept within the constraints of the budget and timeline. They are the realists in a building full of dreamers and dealmakers. Their currency is reliability — the quiet competence of making impossible things happen on schedule.

- **Clients**: They are not the enemy. This is critical. The best version of this game makes the player *understand* the client — understand that the CMO who is asking for "something safe" is doing so because their job is on the line, because last quarter's numbers were bad, because the board is asking questions, because they have a mortgage and two kids and they cannot afford to bet their career on a talking chimpanzee. The client is not an obstacle. The client is a person with their own wound, their own lie, their own desire. The tension is not good-versus-evil. It is vision-versus-survival, and both sides are right.

### Rules of the World

1. **Time is currency.** Every day on the project calendar is a resource. Revisions cost days. Client meetings cost days. Creative breakthroughs cannot be scheduled. The calendar is the game's most ruthless mechanic — it does not care about inspiration or arguments or great ideas. It cares about deadlines.

2. **Trust is earned in drops and lost in buckets.** Client Trust accumulates slowly through delivered promises, met deadlines, and accommodated feedback. It evaporates instantly through missed deadlines, over-budget productions, and public failures. Creative trust within the team follows the same physics — but it is lost by taking bad notes, not by missing deadlines.

3. **Reputation is a story the world tells about you.** The agency's reputation is not a number — it is a narrative that emerges from the pattern of the player's choices. An agency that consistently fights for bold work develops a reputation for boldness, which attracts bold clients and bold talent, which enables bolder work. An agency that consistently plays it safe develops a reputation for reliability, which attracts conservative clients and dependable (but uninspired) talent. Neither path is wrong. Both have consequences.

4. **The ad is never just an ad.** Every campaign the player shepherds from brief to broadcast carries multiple layers of meaning: it is a creative artifact, a business transaction, a relationship test, a reputation data point, and a mirror held up to the player's values. The game never says this explicitly. The systems make it felt.

5. **The Super Bowl changes the physics.** During Super Bowl Sunday, normal rules distort. Stakes amplify. Reactions intensify. A mediocre Super Bowl ad is a disaster because it was supposed to be extraordinary. A great Super Bowl ad is a career-defining triumph because a hundred million people saw it. The Super Bowl is where the game's entire emotional arc comes to a point — and then the next year begins.

### Secrets

Secrets that the player discovers through play, not exposition:

- **The client's hidden priorities**: Every brief has a surface request and an underlying need. The surface says "increase brand awareness." The underlying truth is "the CMO needs a win before the board meeting in March." Learning to read the subtext is one of the game's deepest skill curves.

- **The creative's breaking point**: Every team member has a threshold — a specific combination of compromises that will push them to quit, burn out, or have a creative breakthrough. The player discovers these thresholds through experience, not through stat screens.

- **The industry's memory**: The advertising industry remembers. A campaign the player made three years ago can resurface as a cultural reference, a cautionary tale, or a case study cited by a new client. Nothing is truly disposable. Every ad the player makes enters the world's ongoing conversation.

- **The rival's philosophy**: Competing agencies are not just stat blocks — they have creative philosophies that the player can reverse-engineer by observing their work. Understanding a rival's tendencies creates strategic opportunities: if the rival always goes bold, a well-executed subtle campaign can stand out by contrast.

## 3. CHARACTERS

### Marcus Cole — The Player's Creative Director

- **Role**: The player's senior creative leader. The first hire. The one who believed in this agency when it was just a name on a lease.
- **Desire**: To make one ad that lives forever — the kind of ad that people reference twenty years later, the kind that transcends the product and becomes culture.
- **Need**: To accept that a body of good work is worth more than one perfect piece — that legacy is built in the accumulation, not the lightning strike.
- **Wound**: Marcus spent seven years at a massive agency where his best work was systematically diluted by committee. He left to join the player's agency because he was promised creative freedom. He carries the scar of every compromised concept like a grudge.
- **Lie**: "If I just get the right brief and the right client, I'll make the perfect ad." The truth is that the perfect ad does not exist — but the pursuit of it can produce a hundred great ones, if he stops treating every campaign as his last chance.
- **Arc**: Early game, Marcus is a firebrand — he fights every client note, takes every revision personally, and threatens to quit at least once a year. If the player consistently fights for creative work, Marcus evolves into a mentor figure — still passionate but more strategic, channeling his fire into building a culture of creative excellence rather than winning individual battles. If the player consistently compromises, Marcus becomes increasingly bitter and eventually leaves — and his departure is the game's most emotionally devastating non-failure event.
- **Voice**: Marcus speaks in short, declarative sentences when he is angry and long, image-rich monologues when he is passionate. He curses casually but never cruelly. He references old campaigns the way other people reference scripture.
- **Gameplay Function**: Marcus is the player's creative compass. His reactions to player decisions are a barometer of creative integrity. He generates the highest-quality concepts but is the hardest team member to manage. He is the first character the player must learn to read.

**Voice Sample — Marcus pitching a concept:**
> "Okay. Listen. Forget the product shot. Forget the voiceover. Forget the call to action. I want to show a man sitting alone in a diner at 3 AM. He's staring at a cup of coffee. He hasn't touched it. We hold on that for fifteen seconds — fifteen seconds of nothing. Then he picks it up. He drinks. And in his eyes, you see — I'm not being dramatic here — you see the exact moment someone decides to keep going. We never say the brand name. We show it once, on the cup. End card. That's the ad."

**Voice Sample — Marcus after a client kills his concept:**
> "They want a celebrity. They always want a celebrity. You know what a celebrity in an ad means? It means 'we don't trust the idea to work on its own.' It means 'we're scared.' Fine. Get me the brief for the pharma account. At least pills don't have opinions."

### Diane Xu — The Account Director

- **Role**: Head of client services. The person who keeps the lights on by keeping the clients happy. The player's business conscience.
- **Desire**: To build an agency that is both creatively respected and financially secure — to prove that you do not have to choose between art and solvency.
- **Need**: To admit that she has been using "what the client wants" as a shield against her own creative opinions — that she has taste, and she is afraid to use it because taste is a risk.
- **Wound**: Diane's previous agency collapsed because the founder chased awards at the expense of client relationships. She watched thirty people lose their jobs because the agency's reputation was "brilliant" but its bank account was empty. She will not let that happen again.
- **Lie**: "The client is always right." She knows this is not true. But she believes that acting as if it is true is the only way to keep everyone employed. The cost of this lie is that she sometimes protects the client's preferences at the expense of the work — and the creatives resent her for it.
- **Arc**: If the player demonstrates that bold work can also be good business — that a Clio-winning campaign can also move the sales needle — Diane slowly loosens her grip. She starts advocating for creative risk in client meetings, using data and business logic to make the case for bravery. She becomes the player's most valuable ally because she can make the business case for art. If the player is reckless with client relationships, Diane hardens into a gatekeeper, overriding creative decisions to protect revenue, creating an internal antagonist the player must either accommodate or confront.
- **Voice**: Diane speaks in measured, professional cadences. She uses business language fluently but slips into warmer, more personal tones in private conversations. She says "let's unpack that" when she disagrees. She says "I hear you" when she has already decided. She is the only person in the agency who reads the financial reports for pleasure.
- **Gameplay Function**: Diane is the player's business compass. She provides client intelligence, revenue projections, and strategic advice. Her approval or disapproval of player decisions tracks the business health of the agency. She is the voice that says "we need this account" when the player wants to walk away, and the player must decide whether to listen.

**Voice Sample — Diane briefing the player on a new client:**
> "FlexiCorp. Mid-market athleisure brand, based out of Portland. Revenue's flat, market share is bleeding to three competitors who all have better social presence. Their CMO is new — promoted internally six months ago, so she's got something to prove and not a lot of political capital to prove it with. She's going to say she wants 'disruptive.' What she means is she wants safe with a garnish of disruptive. Give her a concept she can sell to her board. If you give her something she personally loves but can't defend upstairs, she'll kill it and resent you for making her fall in love with something she had to murder."

**Voice Sample — Diane in a private moment:**
> "You know what I wanted to be? Before all this? A filmmaker. I know. Everyone in this building wanted to be something else first. But I was good at the other thing — the money thing, the people thing, the keeping-the-lights-on thing. And I told myself that was enough. Most days it is. Some days Marcus pitches something and I think, 'That's what I would have made.' And then I help him sell it. And I don't know if that's noble or tragic, but it's the truth."

### Jordan Kemp — The Junior Copywriter

- **Role**: The newest member of the creative team. Young, hungry, wildly talented, and completely unprepared for the politics of agency life.
- **Desire**: To be recognized. To hear a senior creative say "that's a good line" and mean it. To prove that they belong in this building.
- **Need**: To learn that recognition from the industry is not the same as satisfaction from the work — that the approval they crave is a mirror of the wound they carry, and true creative fulfillment comes from the making, not the applause.
- **Wound**: Jordan grew up in a family that considered creative work a hobby, not a career. Every day at the agency is an argument with a voice in their head that says "this isn't a real job." They overwork to compensate. They take rejection of their ideas as confirmation of their deepest fear: that their family was right.
- **Lie**: "If I win an award, it will prove I made the right choice." Awards are validation from strangers. What Jordan actually needs is to believe in their own judgment — to reach a point where they can look at a piece of work and know it is good without needing anyone else to confirm it.
- **Arc**: Jordan's arc is the game's coming-of-age story. In the early game, they are eager and fragile — producing inconsistent work that occasionally contains a flash of brilliance. If the player nurtures them (protecting their ideas in meetings, pairing them with good mentors, giving them meaningful projects instead of busy work), Jordan grows into a formidable creative voice — the person who pitches the weird idea that becomes the agency's defining campaign. If the player neglects or exploits them (using them for grunt work, stealing credit, never fighting for their concepts), Jordan burns out and leaves the industry entirely. Their departure is quiet and devastating — a resignation email, a cleaned-out desk, and the knowledge that the player let a great talent die on the vine.
- **Voice**: Jordan speaks quickly, with run-on sentences and sudden pivots. They laugh nervously after pitching ideas. They say "I don't know if this is anything, but —" before every concept, even the brilliant ones. As they mature, the verbal hedging drops. By late game, confident Jordan pitches with the same declarative certainty as Marcus — but warmer, less wounded.
- **Gameplay Function**: Jordan is the player's growth investment. Early-game, they are unreliable but cheap. Nurtured correctly, they become one of the most valuable creatives in the game. They are also the player's emotional anchor — the character whose trajectory most directly reflects the player's leadership style.

**Voice Sample — Jordan pitching, early career:**
> "Okay, um — I don't know if this is anything. But what if — and tell me if this is stupid — what if the ad doesn't have any words? Like, at all? Just a woman walking through a city, and every billboard she passes goes blank when she walks by. And by the end, the whole city is blank except for one thing — the product. On a bench. No logo, no tagline, just... the thing. Sitting there. Being real in a world of noise. I don't know. Is that too weird? That's probably too weird."

**Voice Sample — Jordan, late career (if nurtured):**
> "The ad is this: two strangers on a subway. One is wearing the jacket. The other is not. They never speak. They never acknowledge each other. But the camera knows something they don't — these two people will meet again in thirty years, at a wedding. We show that in a single flash-cut, half a second, in the middle of the spot. If you blink, you miss it. If you catch it, you never forget it. That's the ad. That's the whole ad."

### Victor Sato — The Producer

- **Role**: Head of production. The person who turns concepts into finished ads within the constraints of budget, time, and physical reality.
- **Desire**: To produce something that showcases the full range of what production craft can achieve — a spot so technically flawless that other producers study it.
- **Need**: To understand that perfection is the enemy of feeling — that the most memorable ads in history have imperfections, and those imperfections are what make them human.
- **Wound**: Victor once produced a commercial that won a Grand Prix at Cannes. The ad was technically perfect — every frame, every cut, every sound design choice was immaculate. Nobody remembers it. The ad that beat it for cultural impact was a shaky, under-produced spot with a real family that felt unscripted. Victor has never recovered from the lesson that craft without soul is forgettable.
- **Lie**: "If the production value is high enough, any concept will work." He knows this is not true. But controlling production quality is the one variable he can actually control, so he clings to it.
- **Arc**: Victor's arc is about letting go — learning to serve the concept instead of showcasing the craft. If the player pushes him toward rawer, more authentic production styles, Victor initially resists, then slowly discovers that restraint is its own form of mastery. If the player indulges his maximalism, Victor produces increasingly expensive, technically perfect, emotionally hollow work — and the game's audience metrics reflect it.
- **Voice**: Victor speaks in precise, technical language. He quotes budget figures from memory. He says "we can do that" about impossible things and "that's going to be a problem" about easy things, because his definition of "problem" is "anything that compromises quality." He is dry, occasionally funny, and deeply loyal to people who respect his craft.
- **Gameplay Function**: Victor is the player's production pipeline. His stats and morale directly affect the finished quality of every ad. He translates the player's budget allocation decisions into tangible outcomes. Managing Victor is about resource management — giving him enough to do excellent work without letting him gold-plate every frame.

**Voice Sample — Victor assessing a production plan:**
> "We can shoot that for two hundred K if we use a practical location and a no-name director. We can shoot it for five hundred K if you want the director who did the Apex Auto spot last year — the one with the rain. If you want rain and a helicopter and the tracking shot Marcus keeps talking about, you're looking at seven fifty minimum, and we'll need to move the shoot date back two weeks. I'm not telling you what to do. I'm telling you what things cost."

**Voice Sample — Victor, after a low-budget ad unexpectedly succeeds:**
> "I shot that on a RED One with available light in a parking garage. The audio was room tone and a licensed track we got for eight hundred dollars. Total production cost was less than my last catering budget. And it outperformed every spot I produced last year. I need to sit with that for a while."

### The Clients — Recurring Archetypes

Clients in UPFRONT are not generic quest-givers. They are characters with their own pressures, ambitions, and fears. The player meets them across campaigns and years, and the relationships deepen.

#### Helen Park — The Safe Giant (MegaBev Corporation)

- **Role**: VP of Marketing at MegaBev, a massive beverage conglomerate. She oversees a portfolio of brands and a budget that could fund a small nation.
- **Desire**: Consistency. She wants campaigns that reinforce brand positioning without risk. Her nightmare is a headline that says "MegaBev Ad Sparks Controversy."
- **Need**: To take one real creative risk before she retires — to produce one piece of work that she is genuinely proud of, not just professionally satisfied with.
- **Wound**: Helen greenlit a bold campaign early in her career. It won awards. It also confused consumers, and sales dipped for one quarter. She was nearly fired. She has played it safe ever since — not because she lacks taste, but because she learned that taste has a price.
- **Lie**: "The market research tells us what people want." Market research tells you what people say they want, which is different.
- **Voice**: Corporate-warm. She uses phrases like "let's align on this," "I want to make sure we're protecting the brand," and "I love it — but." The "but" is always coming. Always.

**Voice Sample:**
> "This is really strong work. I mean that. The team should feel great about this direction. I just — and I want to be careful how I say this — I think we need to gut-check the humor angle. Our consumers skew fifty-four and older in the Midwest corridor, and I'm not sure they're going to get the reference. Can we explore a version that keeps the emotional core but dials back the joke? I'm not saying kill it. I'm saying... let's have a safety net."

#### Ray Donovan — The Desperate Startup (ZipLink)

- **Role**: Founder and CEO of ZipLink, a tech startup that does something involving social networking and local businesses. Even Ray is not entirely sure what the product is.
- **Desire**: Explosive growth. He wants a Super Bowl ad because he believes one viral moment will make ZipLink a household name. He has bet everything on this.
- **Need**: A coherent brand identity. ZipLink does not have a positioning problem; it has an existence problem. No ad can fix what the product itself has not defined.
- **Wound**: Ray sold his first startup for nothing because he was too early. He will not be too early again. The terror of irrelevance drives every decision.
- **Lie**: "A great ad will fix everything." A great ad for a product nobody understands is just an expensive riddle.
- **Voice**: Fast, evangelical, buzzword-heavy. He says "disruptive" and "paradigm" without irony. He genuinely believes everything he says, which makes him both exhausting and oddly endearing.

**Voice Sample:**
> "I love this. I love the energy. But can we make it bigger? Like, BIGGER bigger. What if instead of one guy, it's a thousand guys? A flash mob. No — a million people. We show the whole world using ZipLink simultaneously. Like that scene in the Matrix, but for local commerce. Is that crazy? I know that's crazy. But is it? Here's what I know: nobody remembers small. Super Bowl is big. ZipLink is big. Let's be big together."

#### Margaret Ellis — The Legacy in Decline (Carver & Sons Automobiles)

- **Role**: Fourth-generation CEO of Carver & Sons, a heritage American car manufacturer whose market share has been declining for fifteen years.
- **Desire**: To restore the brand's cultural relevance without betraying its identity. She wants people under forty to consider buying a Carver.
- **Need**: To accept that the brand her grandfather built no longer exists in the culture the way it once did — and that reinvention is not betrayal.
- **Wound**: Margaret's father drove the company into near-bankruptcy with reckless modernization attempts in the nineties. She took over and stabilized through conservative management. She is terrified of change because the last time her family tried it, they almost lost everything.
- **Lie**: "Our brand speaks for itself." It did, once. It doesn't anymore. The world moved, and Carver did not move with it.
- **Voice**: Measured, dignified, precise. She speaks like someone who was raised to run a company — every word considered, every opinion delivered as a statement of fact. She is not cold; she is formal. The warmth is there, underneath the mahogany.

**Voice Sample:**
> "My grandfather said a car ad should make you feel like you're already driving. Not show you the car — make you feel the road. We've lost that. Somewhere between the focus groups and the demographic targeting, we lost the road. I don't need you to make people want a Carver. I need you to make people remember what wanting felt like. Can you do that? Not with tricks. Not with celebrities. With the truth of what this car is."

## 4. TONE GUIDE

### Adjectives

**Amber-lit. Wry. Pressured. Bittersweet. Human.**

The tone of UPFRONT is not cynical. It is *knowing* — the warmth of people who understand exactly how absurd their profession is and choose to care anyway. It is the humor of exhaustion, the romance of deadlines, the particular tenderness that exists between people who have been in a room together at midnight trying to make something good.

### Tone References

- **Mad Men** (AMC, 2007-2015): The gold standard for advertising-world drama. UPFRONT borrows its understanding that the ad industry is a lens for examining larger questions about identity, ambition, and the stories we tell ourselves. We take the emotional complexity but not the darkness — our game is warmer, funnier, more hopeful.

- **30 Rock** (NBC, 2006-2013): The understanding that creative work is simultaneously sacred and absurd. The comedy of UPFRONT lives in this register — never mocking the characters for caring, but always acknowledging the inherent ridiculousness of caring this much about a thirty-second commercial for energy drinks.

- **The Gruen Transfer** (ABC Australia, 2008-present): The dissection of advertising as both art and manipulation. UPFRONT's intellectual framework — the idea that ads are cultural artifacts worthy of analysis — comes from Gruen's DNA.

- **Halt and Catch Fire** (AMC, 2014-2017): The emotional arc of creative people building something together in an industry that is about to be transformed by technology they cannot yet see. The bittersweet temporal quality — "this world is ending, and we are making beautiful things inside it" — is pure Halt and Catch Fire.

- **Game Dev Tycoon** (Greenheart Games, 2012): The structural reference. A tycoon game about a creative industry that takes its subject seriously. UPFRONT aims for the same "I'm learning how this industry works" satisfaction, but with deeper character dynamics and moral friction.

### Dialogue Rules

1. **Nobody speaks in exposition.** Characters never explain the world to each other. They speak from within it. A creative director does not say "as you know, the Clios are the most prestigious advertising awards." They say "if this doesn't win at least a Silver, I'm quitting."

2. **Business language is a character trait, not a neutral register.** When Diane says "let's align on the deliverables," that word choice reveals who she is. When Marcus says "the ad doesn't work," the bluntness reveals who he is. Vocabulary is character.

3. **Humor is earned, never forced.** The game is funny because the situations are funny — the absurdity of arguing passionately about whether a chimpanzee should wear a hat. The game never winks at the camera. The characters take their work seriously, and the comedy comes from the gap between the seriousness and the subject.

4. **Silence is a tool.** The most powerful moments in the game should be the ones with the least dialogue. The pause after a concept is killed. The silence in the room after a Super Bowl ad airs. The empty desk where a departed colleague used to sit. What the game does NOT say matters as much as what it does.

5. **Every character believes they are the hero.** The client who kills a great concept is not a villain — they are a protagonist in their own story, making the best decision they can with the information they have. Dialogue reflects this. Even the most frustrating character has a logic that, if you listen, makes sense.

### What This World Is NOT

- **It is not cynical.** The advertising industry is easy to mock. UPFRONT does not mock it. It examines it with affection and honesty. The characters are not sellouts — they are people who chose a profession that sits at the intersection of creativity and commerce, and they are navigating that intersection with varying degrees of grace.

- **It is not a satire.** There is no authorial voice above the characters, pointing down and laughing. The game is at eye level with its world. When something is absurd, the characters notice — but they notice from inside, not from above.

- **It is not grimdark.** There are no villains. There are no evil corporations. There are people with competing needs and limited resources, making decisions under pressure. The worst thing that happens in UPFRONT is not a catastrophe — it is a compromise that didn't have to happen.

- **It is not nostalgic.** The 2000s setting is not a theme park. The game does not fetishize the era. It uses the specific constraints and textures of 2003 — the technology, the culture, the politics — as a narrative framework. The CRT monitors and the AIM windows are not there because they are cute. They are there because they define how these people work and communicate.

- **It is not about advertising.** It is about creative work. Advertising is the arena. The theme is universal: what happens to a vision when it must survive contact with authority, money, and other people's fear.

### Sample Passages

**Environmental Text — Agency Kitchen Whiteboard (Monday Morning After a Failed Campaign):**

> DAYS UNTIL SUPER BOWL: 112
>
> Whoever took my yogurt: I know who you are. — S.
>
> REMINDER: All-hands at 3 PM. Yes, it's mandatory. Yes, we know.
>
> "The FlexiCorp spot tested in the bottom quartile. We'll discuss next steps." — D. Xu
>
> [Written below in different handwriting:] We didn't lose because the ad was bad. We lost because the ad we presented wasn't the ad we made.

**Narrative Moment — The Morning After Super Bowl Sunday (Agency-Defining Success):**

> The agency is quiet in a way it never is. Not empty-quiet — full-quiet. Everyone is here, but nobody is working. They are reading. Every screen in the bullpen shows a different website, a different forum, a different review, and they all say some version of the same thing: *people are talking about your ad.* Not the product. The ad. Jordan is sitting at their desk with headphones in, watching the spot for what must be the thirtieth time, and they are crying a little, which they will deny if you ask. Marcus is in his office with the door closed, on the phone with someone — an old colleague, maybe, or a journalist, or his mother. Diane is at her desk with a spreadsheet open, but she is not looking at the spreadsheet. She is looking at the framed storyboard on the wall — the first ad this agency ever made, back when the walls were bare and the coffee was worse. Victor is in the edit suite, alone, rewatching the final cut with the sound off, studying each frame with the reverence of a restorer examining a painting. Nobody speaks. Everyone knows. This is the morning you all came here for.

**Narrative Moment — A Creative Director Resigns:**

> Marcus leaves on a Thursday. He does not make a speech. He does not slam a door. He packs a single box — the Clio he won at the old agency, a photo of the team from last year's holiday party, a copy of the brief that started the BrightBurst campaign that he still believes was the best concept they never made. He leaves the box on his desk. He walks through the bullpen, and people look up, and he nods at them, and they nod back, and nobody says anything because what is there to say? He chose this agency because he was promised that the work would come first. And you — the player — decided that the client came first instead. He is not angry. He is tired. There is a difference, and the difference is worse.

## 5. NARRATIVE-MECHANIC INTEGRATION

Every mechanic tells a story. The question is whether we are telling the right one.

### The Brief System Tells a Story About Listening

When a client brief arrives on the player's desk, it is not a quest objective. It is a letter from a person who needs something and does not know how to ask for it. The hidden priorities in every brief — the gap between what the client says and what the client needs — are a narrative mechanic, not just a gameplay mechanic. The player learns to read people, not data. The brief teaches empathy, even when empathy is strategically motivated. What does the player FEEL here? The thrill of understanding someone better than they understand themselves.

### The Team Chemistry Engine Tells a Story About Leadership

Assigning creatives to a project is not resource allocation. It is an act of trust. The player is saying "I believe this combination of people can make something extraordinary." When a high-Ego Art Director clashes with a high-Vision Creative Director, the resulting friction is not a bug in the system — it is a story about what happens when two brilliant, stubborn people are forced to collaborate. The player manages this not by optimizing stats but by understanding personalities. Who needs encouragement? Who needs challenge? Who needs to be left alone? Every team assignment is a narrative choice disguised as a management decision.

### The Approval Gauntlet Tells a Story About Courage

The Gauntlet is where the game's central theme becomes a verb. Every time the player pushes back on a client note, they are making a statement about what they believe. Every time they concede, they are making a different statement. The game does not judge these choices — it reflects them. The Gauntlet's genius is that both courage and compromise have costs, and both have rewards, and the player must decide, in real time, which costs they can afford and which rewards they need. What does the player FEEL here? The stomach-turning weight of conviction. The relief of concession. The gnawing doubt of "did I fight hard enough?"

### Super Bowl Sunday Tells a Story About Vulnerability

The moment the player's ad airs, they are not in control anymore. The work is in the world, and the world will decide. The America Reacts panel is not a score screen — it is a mirror. The player watches strangers respond to something they made, and they feel what every creative person feels when their work goes public: naked. The split-second between the ad ending and the reactions beginning is the game's most powerful narrative beat — because in that silence, the player confronts the fundamental question of all creative work: *was it good enough?*

### Environmental Storytelling Opportunities

- **The whiteboard** in the kitchen changes every in-game week, reflecting morale, deadlines, and the emotional temperature of the agency. Players who read it learn things they cannot learn anywhere else.
- **Desk clutter** evolves over time. A creative who is thriving has a cluttered, lively desk. A creative who is burning out has a bare one. A desk that is suddenly empty tells the loudest story of all.
- **The lobby wall** accumulates framed campaigns over the years. By late game, walking through the lobby is walking through the player's creative history — every poster a memory, every campaign a choice.
- **Office ambiance** shifts with agency morale. High morale: music from someone's speakers, laughter from the kitchen, the productive buzz of a team in flow. Low morale: silence, empty desks, the particular fluorescent hum that only becomes audible when nobody is talking.

### Narrative Rewards for Exploration

- **Overheard conversations**: Creatives talk to each other when the player is not directing them. Passing through the bullpen at the right moment reveals character dynamics, brewing conflicts, inside jokes, and creative ideas that the player can choose to act on — or not.
- **Email threads**: A faux-AIM or email system shows inter-office communication. Most of it is mundane. Some of it is revealing. A creative complaining to a friend about a brief. An account exec reassuring a nervous client. A late-night message from someone working alone: "I think this version is better. Don't tell Marcus."
- **Industry news**: The cultural feed in the lobby rewards attention. Trend shifts are telegraphed weeks in advance. A player who reads the feed knows that ironic humor is declining before the metrics confirm it. Narrative and strategy converge.

## 6. LORE HIERARCHY

### Need-to-Know (The Player MUST Understand This)

- You run an advertising agency. You make ads for clients.
- Clients give you briefs. Your team generates concepts. You pitch concepts to clients. Clients approve, request changes, or reject.
- Your agency has two core resources: Client Trust (keeps the business alive) and Creative Integrity (keeps the talent alive and the reputation growing).
- The Super Bowl is the annual climax. Getting there is the goal. What happens there defines your year.
- Your people matter. Who you hire, how you treat them, and which battles you fight on their behalf determines the quality of everything your agency produces.

### Want-to-Know (Enriches the Experience)

- Each client contact has their own career pressures, taste, and hidden priorities. Reading them correctly produces better outcomes.
- Your creative team members have breaking points and growth curves. Their arcs respond to your leadership choices across years, not individual decisions.
- The agency's reputation is a narrative, not a number. It attracts certain clients and repels others. It draws certain talent and loses others. It is the story the industry tells about you.
- Rival agencies have distinct philosophies. Their work can be studied and anticipated.
- The cultural zeitgeist shifts year to year. Ads that resonate with the moment outperform ads that ignore it.

### Deep Lore (Rewards Dedicated Players)

- The dot-com collapse left scars on specific characters. Diane's previous agency died because of it. Ray's first startup was a dot-com casualty. Helen's early career was defined by the excess and the crash.
- The 2000s advertising industry is experiencing a slow-motion tectonic shift. The internet is coming for television's dominance. This is never stated explicitly, but the trends bend toward it — digital budgets creeping upward, younger demographics harder to reach through TV, the first rumblings of what will become social media marketing.
- Every campaign the player makes enters the game's cultural memory. Years later, a new client may reference an old campaign: "We want something like that BrightBurst spot you did in '04." The player's work has a life beyond the transaction.
- Marcus and Diane have a complicated history — they worked at the same agency years ago, before it collapsed. They respect each other deeply and disagree about almost everything. Their dynamic is the agency's founding tension in miniature.
- The kitchen whiteboard contains an evolving meta-narrative across the entire game, written by anonymous members of the agency. Reading it chronologically reveals a story about a community of people going through something together.

### Never-Told (Internal Consistency Only)

- The exact financial structure of the agency's founding. The player started with a small inheritance and one client. The specifics are deliberately vague because the story is about what the player builds, not what they started with.
- The broader economic model of the advertising industry. The game simulates billings, overhead, and profit margins, but the underlying economic logic is simplified for playability. The fiction is that the agency is "small enough that every campaign matters" — the reality is that the simulation does not model industry-accurate accounting.
- The personal lives of the characters outside the office. Marcus has a daughter he does not see enough. Diane runs marathons. Jordan has a band. Victor restores vintage motorcycles. None of this is in the game, but it informs how the characters talk and behave. These people have lives. The player sees the office-shaped part of those lives, and the rest is implied by the specificity of their voices.
- The fates of the real-world advertising agencies and cultural events that the game's fictional world parallels. The game is not an alternate history — it is an inspired fiction. It evokes, rather than recreates, the era.

## 7. TIMELINE OF MAJOR EVENTS

### Pre-Game (Background)

- **1998**: Marcus Cole wins his first Clio at Bernstein-Rowe, a prestigious Manhattan agency. He is thirty-one years old and believes this is the beginning.
- **1999**: The dot-com boom floods agencies with money. Bernstein-Rowe takes on eleven tech clients in nine months. Diane Xu joins Bernstein-Rowe as a junior account manager.
- **2000**: Super Bowl XXXIV features seventeen dot-com ads. The industry believes the money will never stop.
- **2001**: The dot-com crash and September 11th devastate the agency world. Bernstein-Rowe loses eight clients in four months. Marcus watches his best campaign get shelved because "the tone doesn't feel right anymore." Diane watches colleagues get laid off and vows to never let business instability endanger people's livelihoods again.
- **2002**: Bernstein-Rowe collapses. Marcus and Diane, now both unemployed, end up at the same bar on the same Tuesday night. They do not start an agency together. But they both start thinking about it.

### Year Zero (Game Begins)

- **Early 2003**: The player opens a small agency in Manhattan. Marcus is the first creative hire. Diane is the first account-side hire. The office is half-empty. The lobby wall has no framed campaigns. The kitchen whiteboard says "DAYS UNTIL WE'RE SOMEBODY: ???"
- The player takes their first brief from a small, unglamorous client. The work is modest. The budget is tight. But the team is energized because everything is new, and possibility smells like burnt coffee and expo markers.

### Year One: Foundations

- **Q1**: First campaigns. The player learns the rhythm of brief-to-broadcast. First encounter with the Approval Gauntlet. First client pushback. First revision. First moment of "the ad we made is not the ad we pitched."
- **Q2**: Jordan Kemp is hired as a junior copywriter. They are nervous and overqualified and desperate to prove themselves. Their first pitch is a disaster. Their second pitch has one line that makes Marcus look up from his phone.
- **Q3**: Victor Sato is brought on to run production. He takes one look at the edit suite and says "this is unacceptable." The first budget fight ensues.
- **Q4**: First year-end. The agency has survived. Awards season passes without a nomination. The player learns that survival is not the same as success. The whiteboard now says "NEXT YEAR."

### Year Two: Ambition

- The player has enough reputation to attract mid-tier clients. Campaign complexity increases. The first multi-campaign juggle begins. Team dynamics start to matter — chemistry conflicts, ego management, creative differences.
- First realistic shot at a Super Bowl slot. The media buy auction is expensive and terrifying. The player must decide: risk the budget on a Super Bowl bid, or invest in safe, reliable campaigns that build the foundation?
- If the player reaches the Super Bowl: the first Super Bowl Sunday sequence. Exhilarating regardless of outcome. The ad airs. America reacts. Monday morning arrives. Everything is different.

### Years Three to Four: The Crucible

- The agency has an identity now — and that identity has consequences. Bold agencies attract bold clients (high reward, high risk). Safe agencies attract conservative clients (reliable revenue, creative stagnation). The player begins to feel the long-term weight of their choices.
- Key character arcs reach inflection points. Marcus either becomes a mentor or begins his departure arc. Jordan either blossoms or withers. Diane either loosens her grip or tightens it. Victor either discovers restraint or doubles down on maximalism.
- Rival agencies become a factor. Competition for clients, awards, and Super Bowl slots intensifies. The player sees rival work and must respond — not just strategically, but creatively.
- The cultural zeitgeist shifts noticeably. What worked two years ago may not work now. The player must adapt without losing their identity.

### Years Five and Beyond: Legacy

- The late game is about reflection and consequence. The agency is established. The question is no longer "will we survive?" but "what did we become?"
- The lobby wall is full of framed campaigns. The player walks past them and remembers each one — the fights, the compromises, the victories, the losses. This is environmental storytelling at its most personal: the player's own history, rendered in set decoration.
- New hires look up to the player's team the way Jordan once looked up to Marcus. The cycle of mentorship and creative inheritance begins.
- The industry is changing. Digital is rising. The 30-second spot is losing its monopoly on cultural attention. The game does not spell out what this means — it lets the player feel the tide shifting, and it asks, quietly: *what was it all for?*
- The final Super Bowl — whenever the player chooses to stop — is the game's emotional climax. Not because of the score, but because of the accumulated weight of every brief, every pitch, every fight, every compromise, every 2 AM whiteboard message that led to this moment. The player watches their ad air, and they know — in the way that only a game can make you know, because you lived it — exactly what it cost to make.

## 8. OPEN QUESTIONS

These are not flaws. They are the places where the narrative still has room to breathe. Every question is a door, and every door leads somewhere worth exploring.

### Character Questions

- **What happens to Marcus if he stays?** If the player fights for creative work and Marcus remains, where does his arc go in years five and beyond? Does he become a contented elder statesman, or does his perfectionism find new targets? The late-game Marcus needs a new want — not "make the perfect ad," but something that reflects his growth. A mentorship arc with Jordan is the obvious answer; a creative crisis that forces him to reinvent his approach is the more interesting one.

- **Can a client become a friend?** If the player works with Helen Park for five years, does the relationship transcend the professional? Can a client-agency relationship develop genuine intimacy — and if it does, does that intimacy make the creative negotiation harder or easier? The answer should be "both," and the game should model that complexity.

- **Who is the player?** The player character is deliberately undefined — a blank slate for projection. But absence of character is not the same as presence of character. Where is the line? Does the player ever have personal stakes beyond the agency? A spouse who asks why they are working late again? A mentor who calls to check in? The risk is overwriting the player's identity. The reward is emotional depth that pure systems cannot generate.

### World Questions

- **How explicitly does the game address September 11th?** The game is set in 2003. The event is two years old. It reshaped advertising profoundly — tonal shifts, patriotic branding, the complicated politics of selling things in a grieving country. The game should not ignore it, and it should not center it. The answer is environmental: the cultural trend system reflects the post-9/11 tonal landscape. Patriotic messaging tests well. Irony tests poorly. The player navigates this not through dialogue about the event but through the creative work they choose to make. The world changed. The ads reflect it. The player decides how.

- **When does the internet become unavoidable?** In 2003, television is king. By 2006, YouTube exists. The game's timeline will eventually collide with the digital revolution. Does the game end before this collision? Does it model the shift? A late-game expansion where digital campaigns become an option — and threaten to obsolete the player's core competency — is narratively rich and mechanically ambitious. It is also a potential sequel, not a v1 feature.

### Tonal Questions

- **How funny is this game?** The pitch references 30 Rock and The Gruen Transfer. The sample dialogue is wry but not comedic. Where is the comedy line? The answer, I think, is that the game is consistently witty and occasionally very funny, but the humor never undercuts the emotional stakes. The funniest moments should come from character — from the specific, recognizable absurdity of creative people arguing about fonts and chimpanzees — not from the game winking at the player. When the game is funny, it is funny the way a good workplace is funny: because the people are real and the situations are absurd and nobody involved thinks they are being funny.

- **Can the player fail?** Not in the "game over" sense — the agency can always survive, even if it survives as a diminished version of itself. But the game should be capable of delivering emotional failure: the Super Bowl ad that bombs, the creative director who leaves, the year where every campaign is competent and none of them matter. These failures should hurt. Not in a punitive way, but in a human way — the way it hurts to look at something you made and know it could have been better if you had been braver. That is the wound this game explores. The player should feel it, not just see it on a metrics screen.

- **What is the last thing the player sees?** The final image of a career playthrough. The lobby wall, full of campaigns. The empty bullpen at the end of a Friday. A whiteboard with no countdown, just a message: "It was worth it." Or maybe nothing. Maybe the game ends on the sound of a phone ringing — a new client, a new brief, a new chance to make something. The ending should feel like a beginning. Because that is what creative work is: an endless series of beginnings, each one carrying the weight of everything that came before.

*This narrative bible is a living document. It breathes. It grows. It argues with itself at midnight and scrawls answers on the kitchen whiteboard. Every mechanic tells a story. The story UPFRONT tells is about the cost and the glory of making things for other people — and the version of yourself that emerges from the negotiation. The world's wound is the gap between vision and commerce. The player's wound is the gap between the work they made and the work they could have made. The game's gift is making that gap feel like the most important space in the world — because for the people who live in it, it is.*
